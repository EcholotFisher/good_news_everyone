1,"With state budget stalled, Choose Chicago cuts staff - Chicago Tribune","With $7.2 million of its funding frozen by the state's ongoing budget stalemate, Choose Chicago, the city's official tourism arm, is laying off one-fourth of its workforce and closing two international offices.
The cutbacks, announced Friday, saw Choose Chicago eliminate 28 positions, including 15 full-time employees. If state funding isn't restored, there is likely more downsizing ahead, said President Don Welsh. Choose Chicago expects to save $2.5 million.
While tourism has been on the upswing, Chicago's Olympic bid chased away convention bookings for 2016 just as an abundance of new hotel rooms have come online, according Welsh.
""You've got this perfect storm that's brewing out there,"" Welsh said. ""Under no circumstances should we be slowing down our sales and marketing activities this year and leading into 2016.""
Chicago surpassed 50 million visitors for the first time last year, and Choose Chicago's data project the city to top 51 million in 2015. That may be tough to match in 2016, with 200,000 fewer convention room nights on the books, Welsh said. Meanwhile, there are more than 2,000 additional rooms to fill, with the opening of 10 new hotels in 2015.
The state provides about 40 percent of Choose Chicago's $30 million annual budget. The Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority contributes 30 percent, with the city and private donations making up the balance.
In June, Choose Chicago pulled the plug on the last two months of its ""Chicago Epic"" tourism advertising campaign after Gov. Bruce Rauner vetoed the bulk of the state's budget.
Choose Chicago representatives say the agency bought time by carving nearly $6 million out of its budget. Welsh called laying off employees a last resort.
While Chicago joined New York and Orlando as the only U.S. cities to top the 50 million-visitor mark, it is No. 10 nationally among international tourists with 1.3 million visitors last year.
Choose Chicago is closing its sales operations in Canada and Mexico. It continues operations at its four offices in China.
Choose Chicago was formed in 2012 through a merger of the city's convention bureau and tourism office. The organization has played a role in bringing some events to Chicago, including the NFL Draft, which is returning in 2016.
Welsh said Choose Chicago hopes to restore its budget next year, including state funding of $13 million, based on projected hotel tax revenue. It has a contingency budget of $18 million if state funding doesn't materialize, likely necessitating additional reductions.
""We would probably go back to what we were five, 10 years ago, and we would be very myopically focused on being a convention bureau,"" Welsh said. ""And we would have to right-size the organization for that as well.""

Timelapse: becoming Liza Minnelli Watch Trevor Ashley as he transforms into the lead character for upcoming show 'Liza's back! (is broken)'.
PT0M32S http://www.canberratimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-44ow9 620 349 October 17, 2015 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings After more than 500 performances playing it straight, cabaret star Trevor Ashley is going back to what he does best – Liza Minnelli.
Ashley, currently appearing as the grotesque buffoon Monsieur Thenardier​ in the Australian production of Les Miserables , is working on his first solo show in almost three years and is training his kohl-rimmed sights on the Broadway star for the Melbourne-only run of  Liza's Back! (is broken) . 
It's a welcome return to form for Ashley who has carved out a long career as a drag and musical theatre performer, one who spent his youth in singing and acting training but got his professional start as a 20-year-old among the drag queen veterans at Sydney's Albury Hotel.

""I like creating a piece, I like being with it from the ground up and being able to get the whole picture in my head of what I like and what I want to see,"" he says on a brief day trip to Melbourne, hours before he's due on stage again in Sydney in French revolutionary garb. ""I love performing in musicals but I find something like this a lot more challenging and rewarding as a performer.""
Advertisement As Minnelli in  Liza's Back! (is broken) , Ashley imagines all the roles the starlet should have or could have sung, from the The Sound of Music to Wicked , and builds on his wild  Liza (On an E) show of a few years ago. Drag has been good to Ashley and led to breakout roles in stage productions of  Priscilla: Queen of the Desert and Hairspray  but it's arguably been his blackly comic turn in Les Mis that's won him the most critical acclaim (and a 2015 Helpmann nomination) as well as what's turned out to be a rare opportunity in his career: playing a man.
""There's very few people who have thought of me as an actor, as a male. And it's kind of funny because I go, well what do you think I'm doing when I'm being these people? It's just acting, it's just playing a character,"" he says.
The process of putting on Liza's ""face"" takes Ashley about 40 minutes. Photo: Joe Armao 
Yet it was Ashley in drag, or at least playing one of his female characters in the Annie -inspired cabaret Little Orphan trAshley , that originally caught the eye of Les Mis producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh, he says. Les Miserables tackles Brisbane next and it will be January before audiences will see him rasping through Minnelli's songbook again. Ashley hopes his time as Thenardier proves to audiences that he has an acting range that goes beyond fabulous wigs and make-up. But hang up his heels? Not likely.
""I'll never do that because that's ridiculous. But you do sometimes think well, maybe that's what I should do if I want to change people's idea of me. But, you know, I've just played a disgusting man for two years so hopefully people have seen that and seen that it's different.""
Liza's Back! (is broken) is at the Fairfax Studio, Arts Centre Melbourne from January 21-31.

4,Oscar Pistorius to be released from jail on Oct. 20,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) - Oscar Pistorius, the Olympic runner who shot his girlfriend to death on Valentine's Day 2013, can leave prison and move to house arrest next week, South Africa's Department of Corrections said Thursday.
A parole board at the prison where Pistorius has served nearly a year of his five-year sentence for manslaughter made the decision. It came after an initial ruling to release the double-amputee athlete in August was canceled.
The board ""approved the placement of offender Oscar Pistorius under correctional supervision as from 20 October 2015,"" the corrections department said in Thursday's statement.
Pistorius was acquitted of murder last year for the shooting death of Reeva Steenkamp, but prosecutors have appealed that decision and will seek a murder conviction again at South Africa's Supreme Court on Nov. 3.
If Pistorius is convicted of murder by a panel of judges at that appeal, he faces a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison.
The corrections department said the parole board made the decision after receiving a submission from Steenkamp's family.
Pistorius was sentenced to five years after being convicted of culpable homicide, a charge comparable to manslaughter, for shooting Steenkamp, a model and reality TV star. Under South African law, an offender sentenced to five years or less in jail can be released after serving one-sixth - in Pistorius' case 10 months.
He has maintained he thought she was an intruder in his home. Prosecutors said he shot her as she was in a bathroom stall in his Pretoria house during an argument.
He will be moved to correctional supervision, a form of house arrest where he will have to live under certain conditions. Full details of the conditions were not detailed by the corrections department, although it did say that Pistorius would have to continue receiving psychotherapy while under house arrest and would not be allowed to possess a firearm.
In June, the parole board cleared Pistorius to be released from Kgosi Mampuru II Prison in Pretoria on Aug. 21 only for that decision to be suspended by the minister of justice, who ordered a review.
A parole review board then sent Pistorius' case back to the same prison officials to consider again.
The 28-year-old Pistorius will now be able to leave prison on Tuesday. He is expected to serve his house arrest at his uncle's home in an upmarket suburb of Pretoria.",-0.9947,0.026699134199134195,-0.35294117647058826

6,Feds: Californians in flood areas should buy insurance now,"WASHINGTON -- With a strong El Nino in place, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is urging Californians in flood prone places to buy insurance before it's too late.
FEMA deputy associate administrator Roy Wright said Friday buying flood insurance is the most powerful action residents can take with the El Nino, which brings heavy winter rains to California.
Between 50 to 70 percent of Californians who live in high risk flood areas don't have federal flood insurance. People can check at www.floodsmart.gov . Wright said flood insurance has to be purchased 30 days before a flood hits.
Wright said if you buy flood insurance for just one year this is the year because more than one-third of California flood insurance claims in the past 27 years came in just four El Nino years.

News of the concert-in-the-buff came from The Flaming Lips, the psychedelic alternative rock band that in recent months has begun a partnership with the Disney star turned twerker.
Cyrus ""is planning a show where her, the band (us) and the audience are all COMPLETELY naked with milk (well white stuff that looks like milk) ...being spewed everywhere,"" Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne wrote on Instagram on Tuesday.
He did not reveal further details -- or ticket information -- but said the naked show would be filmed for a music video.
Laws on public nudity vary widely around the world, but Cyrus and The Flaming Lips presumably would work with a private venue.
The 22-year-old Cyrus, who describes herself as pansexual and has not been shy about sexually explicit performances, in August released a surprise album, ""Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz,"" in a collaboration with The Flaming Lips.
While the 54-year-old Coyne and his bandmates are less known for sex appeal, The Flaming Lips have been known since the 1990s for energetic and extravagant concerts in which the singer surfs through the crowd from inside a balloon.

In this June 6, 2014 photo, she's drinking apple juice. (Source: Ron Cohn/The Gorilla Foundation) 
(RNN) - Koko the gorilla, famous for learning American Sign Language and as a symbol for wildlife and gorilla preservation, has adopted two new kittens. 
Koko chose the two kittens from a litter. They are named Ms. Gray and Ms. Black. 
The Gorilla Foundation posted a video of Koko meeting the kittens and interacting with them. 
This isn't the first time Koko has had pets. She made headlines in 1984 when she asked for a pet, and researchers gave in, allowing her to pick a kitten from an abandoned litter. Unfortunately, the kitten, named All Ball, managed to escape and was hit and killed by a car. 
According to researchers, Koko mourned the death of All Ball. Later in 1985, she picked another kitten, Lips, and then one more, Smoky, when researchers feared another gorilla living with her, Michael, would claim Lips. 
Since then, Koko has interacted with many kittens, which often only come to visit. 
Koko is part of a long-term research project studying non-human communication. She was born July 4, 1971 and has lived most of her life with researcher Penny Patterson, who began caring for Koko when she was about 1 year old. 
According to the Gorilla Foundation , Koko has learned to use more than 1,000 signs and understands about 2,000 spoken English words. She can also combine the words she knows to convey new meanings. 
The foundation also said Koko is not the only gorilla who has learned sign language. Two other gorillas, Michael and Ndume, were part of the research project and learned sign language. Michael passed away in 2000. 
Koko's project is now aiming to study the emotional awareness of gorillas. ",-0.93,0.12579201101928372,-0.05
10,Usher and Harry Belafonte talk activism in joint appearance,"  Usher and Harry Belafonte… Usher and Harry Belafonte talk activism in joint appearance By HILLEL ITALIE October 25, 2015 9:51 am 
NEW YORK (AP) — As he considered his growing commitment to activism, Usher only needed to look at the man seated next to him, Harry Belafonte, to know how much more he could give. 
“Unfortunately, no matter what I say I’m never going to be able to upstage (Belafonte),” the million-selling musician joked during a weekend appearance at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan. 
In an hourlong conversation moderated by Soledad O’Brien, the 37-year-old Usher and 88-year-old Belafonte related with obvious warmth to each other as fellow artists, activists and celebrities and as elder statesman and protege. 
Usher called Belafonte a hero, mentor and father figure. And Belafonte spoke far more positively about young black celebrities than he did two years ago when he chastised Jay Z, Beyonce and others for turning “their back on social responsibility.” 
At the 92nd Street Y, Jay Z was in the audience nodding his head as Belafonte praised him, Usher and Common for renewing a commitment to change after a “very me” generation immediately following the civil rights era. 
“I’m glad I lived long enough to see this emergence,” he said. 
Usher has a new single out, “Chains,” which protests racism and police violence. “Chains” features cameos by Nas and Bibi Bourelly, and an interactive video that stops playing if you turn away from the images of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and other black men who were killed recently. The video was made with the assistance of Belafonte and his nonprofit organization www.sankofa.org, which supports social engagement by artists. 
“This conversation comes at a time when I think it’s a necessity for us as artists to use our platforms in a significant way,” Usher said, adding that Belafonte and his peers “used everything they’ve got, or they had, in order for us to have that platform.” 
Speaking before an admiring, multigenerational crowd that often called out praise and encouragement, Belafonte assumed the role of teacher, summarizing the history of black resilience dating back to slavery and defining the power of art as a way to slow “the rush to the bank.” He has criticized President Barack Obama in the past as too cautious and at the 92nd Street Y ridiculed Obama’s campaign slogan “Yes We Can.” 
“The political cleverness, if you want to call it that, (is) the sentence was never finished,” Belafonte said. “Yes we can what?” 
Usher, meanwhile, was eager to complete that sentence. He became tearful as he spoke of making the country “a land of hope” and seemed to be asking himself as much as anyone where any future movement might lead. 
“I’m inquisitive in my young age,” he said, calling “Chains” the beginning of a conversation. “When do we really face the issues that are within our system?” 
Near the end, the subject briefly turned from politics and social causes when an audience member asked if Usher and Belafonte would sing together. Usher was doubtful, noting that he had tried in vain to get Belafonte in the studio. Belafonte had a simple, sad explanation: He had a stroke ten years ago that weakened his vocal cords. 
“In that context, I am not about to let the last thing you remember me (by) is trying to croak out a song,” he said, to laughter and applause. Topics:",0.9225,0.01912050534499515,-0.25

Heavy rain is pummeling Japan for a second straight day, overflowing rivers and causing landslides and localized flooding in the eastern part of the country. by Issei Kato Japan evacuated about 100,000 people from their homes on Thursday, after rare torrential rains unleashed floods that washed away houses and left at least two people missing.
A further 800,000 people across eastern Japan have been advised to evacuate after officials issued pre-dawn warnings of unusually harsh rainfall to 5 million people.
Television broadcast pictures of helicopters plucking individuals from rooftops as houses were swept off their footings as rivers burst their banks.
Some areas received double the usual September rainfall within 48 hours after tropical storm Etau swept across the central part of Japan's main island of Honshu.
A 63-year old woman was missing after a landslide hit her home, while a man in his 70s in the town of Joso, about 56 km north of Tokyo, was feared trapped in his home when floods swept it away, NHK national television said.
Japan has put heavy emphasis on disaster prevention since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster that left nearly 20,000 dead. It is eager to avoid the criticism faced by previous governments for what was seen as a sluggish response.
""The government will work as one to prioritise the safety of the people and do our best to prevent any further disaster,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, and warned of unprecedented rains.
Television footage showed people in Joso waving towels while waiting for help on the upper floors of homes engulfed in floods as the Kinugawa river swept through.
 Part of a hotel in the town of Nikko, famed for its shrines and temples, had collapsed, the Kyodo news agency said, but there were no reports of injuries.
Rainfall reached 600 mm in the area around Joso, with weather officials expecting at least 200 mm more in parts of eastern Japan, including Fukushima, the site of the nuclear reactor crippled in 2011, before the downpour stops on Friday.
The Kinugawa river, which runs through Joso, broke its banks at about 12.50 pm, public broadcaster NHK said. TV footage showed houses being dragged away by the flood and helicopters airlifting people from homes in danger of being swept away.
Nearly 300 homes were flooded by early afternoon, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. Kyodo News reported that 2,500 people had been evacuated in Joso, with 39 rescued by the Self-Defense Forces. One person has been reported missing, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters in Tokyo.

16,"After trade deal, Obama seeks to repair rift with labor","By JIM KUHNHENN
Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - After the push for trade legislation ruptured relations between the White House and organized labor, President Barack Obama is embarking on something of a repair mission.
Within just hours of business leaders joining him at a White House signing ceremony for the polarizing trade bill, Obama announced a proposed Labor Department rule that would make more workers eligible for overtime. Just like that, the tables were turned - labor praised the move and business leaders decried it.
On Thursday, Obama is traveling to LaCrosse, Wisconsin, to promote the overtime plan in the home district of Rep. Ron Kind, one of the 28 House Democrats who broke party ranks to side with the president and grant him broad trade negotiating powers.
""It is impossible to insulate the U.S. economy and U.S. workers from the broader forces of globalization,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday. ""While the president and congressman Kind have a difference of opinion with many leaders of organized labor about this approach, the fact is when it comes to the value of looking out for middle-class families, the leaders of organized labor and the Obama administration agree just about every time.""
It's a message the White House hopes resonates with union members and mends a battered relationship between pro-trade Democrats and labor. Union leaders, led by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, fought aggressively against the trade legislation and vowed to pull their support of Democrats who sided with Obama.
That legislation, supported by a majority of Republicans, gave Obama ""fast track"" trade negotiating authority, which could clear the path for him to complete a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal. If finalized, Congress would have the right to approve or reject the agreement, but not change or delay it. The deal could be completed in time for Congress to act before the end of the year, giving labor yet another opportunity to flex its muscle over its fear that a trade deal could cost American jobs.
""The trade fight is not over,"" said Bill Samuel, the AFL CIO's legislative director.
Still, the White House and unions have found plenty of common cause in other areas. Obama has promoted an increase in the federal minimum wage and advocated for paid family and medical leave.
The overtime rule that Obama announced Monday had been long anticipated. It would make up to 5 million more people eligible for overtime by more than doubling the earnings threshold under which salaried workers are entitled to overtime.
But the administration waited until after the trade legislation passed to propose it. The timing avoided what could have been an awkward and perhaps damaging confrontation with the business community while it was promoting the president's trade agenda.
Labor is keeping the issues separate.
""We intend to work with the administration until their last day in office,"" Samuel said. ""We have to do more to address wage inequality than just the overtime rule, but it's key start. The trade agenda pushes us in the other direction.""
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, whose president, Tom Donohue, attended the trade signing ceremony Monday, issued a blistering critique of the overtime rule, saying it would result in workers losing benefits, flexibility and advancement opportunities.
""This change is another example of the administration being completely divorced from reality and adding more burdens to employers and expecting them to just absorb the impact,"" said Randy Johnson, a chamber senior vice president.
Other business groups, whose membership may not be as affected by the overtime provision, took a more measured approach.
Bill Miller, a senior vice president at the Business Roundtable, said his group has ""long advocated modernization and we intend to be part of the rule-making to make it as nondestructive as possible.""
Still trade is a far more defining policy issue.
Miller said it was ""the major centerpiece"" of the Obama administration's business agenda.
""The cooperation, the collaboration and the execution was done in a way that we're very hopeful is the blueprint for going forward in the last 18 months of the administration,"" he said.",0.9729,0.11497493734335841,-0.3103448275862069

(Vipin Kumar/HT Photo) 
Finance minister Arun Jaitley said on Sunday a better monsoon would help check food inflation, pinning hopes on 'rain gods' to be kinder this year. Jaitley also said that rising tax revenues and improving macroeconomic fundamentals would take economy to an accelerated growth trajectory, while 8-10% GDP growth was also not out of sight. ""It appears that the rain gods may be kinder this year to us than they were last year,"" Jaitley said. He said that the Department of Agriculture expects a better rainfall in most parts of the country to result in higher production of oil seeds and pulses, which at the moment are a cause of concern in terms of inflation. ""I hope their estimates turn out to be true,"" Jaitley said, while expressing confidence that the monsoon should be good going ahead also, as was the case in June. On tax revenues, Jaitley said, ""There are some sporadic data which indicate a significant recovery."" ""Yesterday's indirect revenue data for the first quarter did indicate that customs duty, excise duty, service tax, even without additional revenue measures were up 14.5% over the past fiscal,"" he said while speaking at the Nabard Foundation Day celebrations in Mumbai on Sunday. The minister said that the overall growth in indirect tax collection would be 37% if the additional revenue measures are taken into account. ""The silver lining is that revenue situation may be more comfortable... compared to last year. ""And therefore with the ongoing reform process, and some more significant changes like GST in the pipeline, increased infra spending this year, emphasis on smart cities, when all these initiatives get onto the field, then our aspiration to cross that 8% growth and get to the 8-10% level is not something which is completely out of sight. ""... (it is) something which may be imminently achievable,"" he said. 
Pointing to the recent IMF projection of 7.5% growth vis-a-vis the global growth projection of 3.2-3.3% this year, Jaitley said what we need is both higher growth and redistribution of resources. ""We need higher growth on one hand and we need to flag the concerns of the economy in those sections where the benefits of that growth process must reach first,"" he said. On Greece crisis, he noted that the world economy is passing through troubled times. ""We have the lesson from Greece to be learned. And the big message is that the countries must learn to spend within their means. If they didn't do that then they will have unusual crisis confronting you. And therefore we are well tracked on a roadmap where our own fiscal deficit, CAD are broadly coming under control and inflation is under control."" Last week IMF said pegged global economic growth at 3.2-3.3%, while projecting India's growth at 7.5% for financial year 2015. Tags",0.9948,0.18647637085137087,0.0
19,3 ways Jonathan Jaglom is leading Makerbot’s charge for global domination,"Michael del Castillo Jonathan Jaglom, Makerbot’s new CEO, speaks at Internet Week New York, May 18, 2015. In the three months since Jonathan Jaglom stepped into the CEO role at Makerbot — the company's fourth leader in the past two years — he's been a busy guy, according to an interesting rundown offered by Technical.ly . Of the milestones attributed to Jaglom, the former general manager of Stratasys’ Asia Pacific and Japan division, three stand out as part of a strategy that appears to be aimed at turning Brooklyn’s 3D-printing sweetheart into a global brand before the competition elbows them out: Jaglom set up Makerbot APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan) at parent-company Stratasys (Nasdaq: SSYS) Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. Jaglom’s predecessor, Jenny Lawton , now at littleBits , had hoped to manage the expansion directly from Brooklyn, according to the report. To ease concerns over the tumultuous changes in leadership, Jaglom established a “creative council” of about 50 employees from across the company to help define corporate values. Jaglom is embarked on a 22 state “listening tour” to engage in a dialogue with customers, partners, and schools. Related Content",0.9578,0.0979020979020979,-0.14285714285714285

21,Banks in Trouble: DOJ Expands FX-Market Rigging Probe,"Content preferences Done 
Banks, it seems, continue to be haunted by probes related to their past business malpractices. The U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has expanded its investigation for foreign exchange (“FX”) market manipulation to include other currencies, such as Russian ruble, Argentine peso and Brazilian real. This was first reported by Bloomberg, citing persons familiar with the probe.The DOJ is using the cooperation clause included in the agreement with banks in May to extract more information. Further, to resolve the FX probe, the regulator is relying on the information provided by banks during the prior settlement.As per the May agreement, the banks – Citigroup Inc. C, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc RBS, UBS Group AG UBS and Barclays PLC BCS – stand immune from further prosecution in the FX probe, given that they cooperate with regulators during future investigations. Apart from these banks, the DOJ is examining business practices of other financial institutions like Deutsche Bank AG DB.Additionally, the DOJ is expanding its investigation into individuals at major banks, including traders across the globe. The allegations include conspiring to influence emerging market FX rates to boost profits.Notably, the U.S. is not the only country probing the FX-market rigging. Regulators in other countries including Brazil, South Korea, Australia and South Africa have also launched investigations to determine the impact of foreign-currency manipulation by global banks based in the U.K. and the U.S. in their respective nations.Therefore, we believe that FX-market manipulation probes are not likely to end soon. Banks may have to raise their litigation reserves to fulfill future legal costs. Such actions will definitely hit their financials hard.Notably, regulators across the globe, engaged in investigating such rigging and business misconducts, are determined to handle such cases with proper severity. This will dissuade such practices in the future, bringing justice to sufferers and punishing the wrongdoers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

23,Kenya: Kenya Airways Resumes Bangui Flights,"Kenya Airways Resumes Bangui Flights Tagged: Kenya Airways will next month resume flights to Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic. The flights were suspended in March 2013, following a civil unrest in the country. Bangui, which is the largest city in Central African Republic is expected to give the Kenyan national carrier access to more customers. Before the flights were called off, Kenya Airways operated two weekly flights to the city, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. ""Passengers will benefit from our new flights between Bangui and Doula. We will be watching the market closely with a view to adding frequencies in the near future,"" said KQ chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze said on Wednesday. Operations will start with two frequencies per week, directly from Nairobi and from Bangui onwards to Douala in Cameroon. Flights are operated in a Boeing 737-800. REGIONAL MARKET The route enables investors dealing in diamonds, coffee, cotton and timber access to the regional market as well as Europe. Bangui is rich in diamonds and has over four million people who are expected to frequently travel to promising investment hubs including Kenya. KQ applies the 'fifth freedom' between M'Poko International Airport in Bangui and the Douala International Airport in Cameroon. This allows it to carry revenue traffic between the foreign countries connecting flights through Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. 'Fifth freedom' are a set of commercial aviation rights granting a country's airline the privilege to enter and land in another country's airspace. The route is expected to offer easier connectivity for the importers of food and textiles from major suppliers in France, United States of America, Cote d'Ivoire, Germany and Japan. Kenya

24,FinMin says no plan to take general insurance companies public,"FinMin says no plan to take general insurance companies public By PTI | 30 Aug, 2015, 12.14PM IST ET SPECIAL: Love visual aspect of news? Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MUMBAI: Even as the new insurance law has an enabling provision for allowing five public sector general insurers to go public, the government has no plans at present to dilute its stake in them. ""As of now there is no plan to list any of the general insurance companies,"" Financial Services Secretary Hasmukh Adhia , who will take over Revenue Secretary from next month, told PTI. The new Insurance Act allows the government to disinvest its stake in five general insurance companies -- New India Assurance, United India Insurance, National Insurance, Oriental Insurance and sole reinsurer GIC Re. However, the new law keeps Life Insurance Corporation ( LIC ) out of this ambit and therefore will continue to be a 100 per cent state-owned company. ""All the four state-owned general insurance companies are well-capitalised and they don't need capital through IPOs,"" chairman and managing director of a public sector general insurance company said. Analysts believe the government which has disinvested in all the state-owned banks may exercise the same option for state-owned general insurers some time later. ""None of these companies, except one or two, has financials which can really enthuse investors to pick up stake in these companies. All of them continue to have large underwriting losses and low on profitability,"" a market analyst said. However, New India Assurance, which is the largest general insurer, has said the call has to be taken by the government. ""It is up to the government to take a call. We haven't heard anything from them,"" New India Assurance chairman and managing director G Srinivasan had said while announcing the June quarter results recently.

28,Billionaire starts super PAC to push corporate tax revamp,"WASHINGTON (AP) - Billionaire New York investor Carl Icahn said Wednesday he is creating a $150 million super PAC focused on revising corporate tax law.
Icahn will use his super PAC to press Congress to pass legislation that stops U.S. companies from moving their profits overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates - a practice known as ""inversions.""
American corporations - including Apple, one of his own biggest investments - are holding more than $2.2 trillion abroad, Icahn said. The investor laid out his plans in a letter posted on his website, which he said he also delivered to lawmakers.
Icahn said he will seek super PAC donations from others but noted in his letter that his own $150 million should be ""more than enough to make voters fully aware of the horrible consequences"" of inversions. He said in an interview Wednesday on the cable business channel CNBC that he's taking action because he's tired of Congress dodging the issue.
""These guys are unwilling to compromise,"" he said of lawmakers. ""They have to be held accountable."" He said it would take ""a simple law"" to address inversions and ""It's ridiculous not to do it.""
Icahn joins other billionaires, including environmentalist Tom Steyer and gun-control advocate Michael Bloomberg, in using super PACs to tackle a single policy issue. Through these political action committees, those two have spent tens of millions of dollars in recent elections boosting politicians who agree with their viewpoints on those topics and criticizing those who don't.
Steyer and Bloomberg have seen limited success with their political projects.
Although Icahn has not given details about how he'll use the super PAC, his letter indicates it'll focus its financial muscle on members of Congress rather than on the 2016 presidential candidates.
But Icahn, who describes his politics as ""centrist,"" is a friend and supporter of Donald Trump, the celebrity real estate mogul who has dominated the Republican presidential race for months.
Icahn endorsed the fellow billionaire about a month ago in a web video. One of the reasons he gave was their common interest in repatriating corporate money sheltered overseas.

29,David Vitter must beat John Bel Edwards #LAGov | Politics,"(Before It's News)
As Moe mentioned on Saturday night , it will be Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) 84% versus Democrat John Bel Edwards in the race for Louisiana’s next governor. It was a close race, with Vitter trailing another Republican, Scott Angelle, for a good part of the returns coverage. However, Vitter strongholds started showing up on the map and the two flipped. This entire scene comes after a very ugly primary season, which saw everyone throwing whatever mud dug up from Vitter’s past that they could.
And, to be fair, he is a morally flawed candidate. Vitter was not the first choice of the majority of Republicans in the state of Louisiana who voted on Saturday. What’s more, this election was very underwhelming in terms of voter excitement. No one was really all that into it, and it showed in the voter turnout percentages.
The path for Vitter is going to be tough, but it isn’t unwinnable as a lot of “conservatives” in the state would like you to think. He’s still got a few million on hand, and the Republican Governors Association has pledged a few more. This is an off-year, non-federal election, which historically means lower Democratic turnout. As well, the state is a red state, and has been for a while now.
Right now, Vitter is going to have to alienate Edwards by harping on his opposition to school choice ( which I’ve written about before ) and his liberal voting record ( which you can see a good bit of here ) while reconnecting with a Republican base that, while it supported his last election in 2010, appears to have grown ambivalent toward him.

30,Letter From Washington: How the 2016 Race Could Affect Each Party’s Future,"How the 2016 Race Could Affect Each Party’s Future By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW OCT. 25, 2015 Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — Presidential candidates proclaim that there has never been an election as important as this one. “The challenges we face now are direr than any time in our modern history,” said Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic candidate. “This is not a typical election,” said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican candidate. “I think the stakes have never been higher.” Sure, no candidate is going to say this election is no big deal. But more important or more dire than 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression ? Or 1940, on the verge of World War II ? Or 1980 or 2008? In fact, the stakes for the two American political parties could be that great. Consider the likely ramifications of a 2016 defeat for Democrats or Republicans. If the Democrats were to lose the presidency, it would be a near certainty that the party would not regain control of the Senate or the House of Representatives, where Republicans already enjoy comfortable margins. Republicans could control in excess of half the governorships and state legislatures in 2017. And Republican appointees are a majority on the Supreme Court, after a couple 5-to-4 liberal decisions on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage , would probably tilt conservative again. Such a scenario would make Republicans even more powerful than when they held all the levers of power from 2003 until 2007: Then, they didn’t control as much on the state level, and in Congress there still were moderate to liberal party lawmakers, such as Arlen Specter and Lincoln Chafee, who often voted with Democrats. (Both subsequently became Democrats.) The Democrats, who consider themselves the governing party, would be in their weakest position since the 1920s. Moreover, they would be strikingly short of younger fresh faces — who is the party’s equivalent of the 45-year-old Paul Ryan? In the Senate, Harry Reid, 75, is retiring and is likely to be replace as Democratic leader by Chuck Schumer, who will be 66 in January 2017. In the House, Nancy Pelosi, for more than a decade a powerhouse leader, is 75; the No. 2 Democrat, Steny Hoyer, is 76. The party would struggle to find a way to highlight up-and-comers: senators such as Michael Bennet of Colorado, 50, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, 48, or the likely next Maryland senator, whether Chris Van Hollen, 56, or Donna Edwards, 57. For the House, there is Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts, 35, or promising candidates such as 44-year-old Lon Johnson, former state party chairman, running in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The consequences of a loss would be even more cataclysmic for the Republicans, threatening a party split. It would be the sixth of the past seven elections in which Republicans have lost the popular vote. That has never happened before. There are bitter schisms within the party. Mr. Ryan is likely to succeed John A. Boehner this week as House speaker, but there is already betting on how long his honeymoon with rival factions within the party will last. That, along with a divisive presidential contest, foreshadows a blood bath if the party loses next year. If an establishment Republican — Jeb Bush, John Kasich or Marco Rubio — were to win the nomination and lose the election, the right wing would explode. It is an article of faith among the movement that the establishment needs to be decimated before the party can rebuild. A defeat with an establishment candidate would ignite those passions. If one of the outsider candidates — Donald J. Trump, Ben Carson or Mr. Cruz — were to lead the ticket and was routed by a Democrat, the establishment would contemplate ways to diminish the role of those they consider the “nuts” in the party. Unlike with the Democrats, the Republicans do have some younger figures angling for leadership: Mr. Ryan, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio. But none transcend these fissures. And in the unlikely event that Mr. Trump were to win? Republicans and Democrats would both have some serious questions to ask themselves. Loading...",0.9887,0.16221959858323495,-0.2777777777777778
31,One State Finally Cracked Down on Deceptive Anti-Abortion Pregnancy Centers,"One State Finally Cracked Down on Deceptive Anti-Abortion Pregnancy Centers | Mother Jones Quote: California on Friday became the only state to target anti-abortion pregnancy centers with a law cracking down on deceptive practices some have used to prevent or dissuade women from having an abortion. The new law, which forces some crisis pregnancy centers to offer information about public assistance for reproductive services and others to notify patients that there are no medical professionals on staff, passed the California state assembly with a large majority in late May. Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed the bill on Friday night. It is the first time reproductive rights groups have succeeded in pushing regulations on crisis pregnancy centers across an entire state; only a handful of cities or counties have passed similar laws. Shortly before the act became law, Amy Everitt, the director of NARAL Pro-Choice California, a reproductive rights group that helped draft the bill, said in an interview, ""There is more to come.""

32,Comment on Hillary Clinton to raise funds Nov. 4 in Bay Area by RRSenileColumnist,"Saturday, October 24th, 2015 at 9:12 am in 2016 presidential election , campaign finance , Hillary Clinton . 
Here she comes again: Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton will be raising funds in the Bay Area again in the first week of November, after doing so here in May , June , August , and September . 
This time around, she’ll start Wednesday, Nov. 4 in Sacramento, with a $2,700-per-person luncheon hosted by Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis , the U.S. Ambassador to Hungary from 2010 to 2013. Kounalakis is a four-time delegate to the Democratic National Convention and the daughter of Angelo Tsakopoulos, a Sacramento developer, mega-donor to President Bill Clinton, and key fundraiser for Hillary Clinton’s first presidential bid in 2008. 
Then the candidate is headed for Los Altos, where she’ll attend a “family celebration” hosted by Anne, Esther, Janet, and Susan Wojcicki; $1,000 buys admission for one adult and two children under 16, while $2,700 allows that plus a family photo with Clinton. (Apparently there were $500 tickets available too, but those have sold out.) 
Anne Wojcicki is co-founder and CEO of the personal genomics company 23andMe, and the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Susan Wojcicki is the CEO of YouTube. Dr. Janet Wojcicki is a pediatric epidemiologist and assistant professor at the UC San Francisco School of Medicine. The three sisters’ mother, Esther Wojcicki , is a Palo Alto High School journalism and English teacher who is vice chair of the board of Creative Commons. 
Clinton will finish that day down in Beverly Hills with a $2,700-per-person reception at the home of pop star Christina Aguilera and Matthew Rutler; Aguilera will perform. The next day – Thursday, Nov. 5 – she’ll attend a morning event in Los Angeles co-hosted by director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, and interior decorator Michael Smith .

34,Game over,"Hillary Clinton at the Democratic debate Tuesday in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher) (John Locher/AP) By Charles Krauthammer Opinion writer October 15 at 8:45 PM Follow @krauthammer I repeat: Unless she’s indicted, Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination. I wrote that six weeks ago, amid fevered dreams of a Clinton collapse and a Joe Biden rescue. That those were a mirage is all the more obvious after Tuesday’s debate . The reason, then as now, is simple: Clinton has no competition.
She’s up against three ciphers and one endearing, gesticulating, slightly unmoored old man. If Biden was ever thinking of getting into the race, he’d be crazy to do so now. It’s over.
Charles Krauthammer writes a weekly political column that runs on Fridays. View Archive Facebook RSS Indeed, even before the debate, Clinton’s numbers had stabilized. It began with Kevin McCarthy’s gaffe of the decade . That gave her a perpetual get-out-of-jail-free card that she adroitly deploys whenever the e-mail issue arises. Her technique is flawless: a few meaningless phrases about having made a mistake, taking responsibility and being transparent, blah blah, followed by (I paraphrase) “but look at the larger picture, even Kevin McCarthy admits it’s a partisan witch hunt.” Q.E.D.
At the debate, Bernie Sanders sealed the deal with a thunderous “the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails.” That rendered the issue officially off-limits to all Democrats. File closed. End of story. Of course, it will be featured in the general election, but we’re talking here about her getting the nomination.
In gratuitously granting her absolution, Sanders garnered points for high-mindedness. But he’d already cornered the high-mindedness market. Sanders was right to call this move dumb politics. His declaration simply and definitively conceded the race to Clinton. Leo Durocher said nice guys finish last. Sanders will finish second, which in this case is the same thing.
Democratic presidental candidate Hillary Clinton says there is a lot she would do ""to build on the successes of President Obama,"" but says her proposed plans go beyond his current politics. (CNN) Clinton won the debate because it didn’t change the dynamic. It froze the race, and she’s far in the lead. It doesn’t matter that her lead has shrunk from 50 points to 20. Twenty points is a landslide.
She remains a lousy candidate but she is an excellent debater — smart, quick, strategic and extremely practiced. Eight years ago she debated Barack Obama 25 times . Tuesday night she successfully bobbed and weaved and pivoted. She was at her most impressive, however, when she whacked Sanders upside the head — twice — right out of the box. He didn’t know what hit him.
At the very start, she attacked from the left on gun control, from the right on capitalism. She simply said the magic words — small business, too? — and he beat an unsteady retreat. In general, Sanders was wild and wavy and loud and not very nimble. After all, how much practice do you get when for 35 years you’ve been campaigning as a social democrat in Vermont, America’s Denmark?
Sanders is good on an empty podium taking on invisible billionaires. Put him up against a Clinton and he’s lost.
He did make history of a sort, however. Every debate has its moment — the sound bite that lives forever (or until the next debate, whichever comes first). His “damn e-mails” thunderbolt is the first such immortal line to be delivered by one candidate that seals victory for another.
The other three candidates hardly registered. Lincoln Chafee, currently polling at 0.3 points (minus-10 Celsius), played Ross Perot’s 1992 running mate, Adm. James Stockdale, who",0.9724,0.10067460317460317,-0.0851063829787234
35,Playboy to stop running pictures of completely naked women,"LOS ANGELES (AP) - Playboy is about to find out how many people really do read it for the articles.
The magazine that helped usher in the sexual revolution in the 1950s and '60s by bringing nudity into America's living rooms - or at least its sock drawers - announced this week that it will no longer run photos of completely naked women.
Playboy has seen its circulation plunge in recent decades as it has fallen victim to some of the very forces it helped set in motion. First it had to deal with competition from more sexually explicit magazines like Penthouse and Hustler. Now the Internet is awash in high-definition porn.
Playboy has decided that the answer is less skin, not more.
""You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passé at this juncture,"" Playboy Enterprises CEO Scott Flanders told The New York Times.
Starting in March, Playboy's print edition will still feature women in provocative poses, but they will no longer be fully nude. It will become more like Esquire and other magazines with PG-13-type pictures.
The Times said the magazine has not decided whether to continue having a centerfold.
Playboy became famous for publishing naked photos of some of the world's most famous women. Marilyn Monroe was its first centerfold, 62 years ago.
Although the change represents a major shift for the magazine, it is also the latest step away from full nudity, which was banned from Playboy's website in August 2014. That helped make the site safer for work and public places, and enabled Playboy to get onto Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.
The magazine has said its online audience soared with that move, averaging a fourfold increase in monthly unique visitors.
The Times said taking full nudity out of the magazine was also something the 89-year-old Hugh Hefner signed off on when Playboy editor Cory Jones ran the idea by him.
""The political and sexual climate of 1953, the year Hugh Hefner introduced Playboy to the world, bears almost no resemblance to today,"" Flanders said in a statement. ""We are more free to express ourselves politically, sexually and culturally today, and that's in large part thanks to Hef's heroic mission to expand those freedoms.""
The shift will be accompanied by other changes in the magazine, including a slightly larger size and heavier, higher-quality paper meant to give the magazine a more collectible feel.
Playboy's print circulation, measured at 5.6 million in the 1975, is now about 800,000, according to Alliance for Audited Media, the Times reported.

36,Donald Addison Nason sentenced in Provincial Court," Alberta Securities Commission
CALGARY , Oct. 22, 2015 /CNW/ - Donald Addison Nason has been sentenced to an 18-month conditional sentence, or house arrest, after being convicted of 20 counts of breaching Alberta securities laws. Alberta Provincial Court Judge Bruce Fraser also ordered Nason to complete 200 hours of community service and permanently banned him from trading, acting as a director or officer of any issuer, and from acting as an adviser, manager or consultant in connection with activities in the securities market. This sentence will be followed by a period of probation of one year.
In September 2015 , Judge Fraser found Nason guilty of engaging in illegal distributions, multiple breaches of an Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) cease trade order, an unfair trade practise, and making numerous misleading or untrue statements to investors. The convictions stem from the illegal sale of Locate Technologies Inc. securities to investors in the Edmonton area.
In handing down his sentence, Judge Fraser noted that a ""significant aggravating factor"" in this case was that Nason had already been sanctioned for similar offences in relation to the sale of Locate securities in New Brunswick. Judge Fraser stated that Nason was ""a danger to the public and morally corrupt and blameworthy having learned nothing from being previously sanctioned.""
As part of the conditional sentence, during the first nine months Nason must remain in his home (with limited exceptions) 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and for the last nine months he is bound by a curfew and other conditions.
A copy of the decision is available on the ASC website at www.albertasecurities.com .
The ASC is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province's securities laws. It is entrusted with fostering a fair and efficient capital market in Alberta and with protecting investors. As a member of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the ASC works to improve, coordinate and harmonize the regulation of Canada's capital markets.

37,Is an Open House Still a Must-Do Step When Selling Your Home?,"Despite all the changes technology has made in how house are bought and sold, one standard feature of the process remains: the Sunday open house.
Shortly after a house goes on the market, the listing agent will set aside a Sunday afternoon to welcome prospective buyers (plus nosy neighbors) to see the house at its best.
But has the open house gone the way of the landline and outlived its usefulness? It depends whom you ask. Some agents believe modern life has rendered open houses unnecessary, while others believe they are more important than ever.
""It's very, very important you have open houses, especially the first few weeks when [the home is] on the market,"" says Steven Aaron, head of the Steven Aaron Realtor Group at Keller Williams Beverly Hills. ""It makes it convenient for the buyers to come and see the house without an appointment.""
Craig McClelland, CEO of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Metro Brokers in Atlanta, agrees about the importance of open houses.
""I think it's a great way to expose the house to people who are driving around,"" McClelland says. ""People want that instant gratification. … People want to see it now.""
But some agents say that, far from finding open houses convenient, today's buyers want to see homes on their own schedule. Kevin Kudrna, a team leader and broker for Redfin in Colorado Springs, Colorado, says he tells his sellers that the chance of selling a home to someone who attends an open house is so small that it's not worth the trouble.
""In 2015, an open house isn't what it used to be,"" Kudrna says. More than 90 percent of buyers start their searches online , according to the 2014 National Association of Realtors' Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, and the photos and videos let them rule out many homes without having to visit. ""When the Internet started to bring all the listings online, people didn't have as much of a need to go into the houses.""
Kudrna does admit there is an advantage to open houses. ""When someone is looking into the neighborhood, it's right there in front of them,"" he says. But, he adds, ""There are so few [open houses] it doesn't provide much opportunity.""
There are no reliable statistics on how many home sales occur because of open houses. The 2014 NAR Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers found that 9 percent of buyers found the home they purchased from a yard sign or open house, down from 15 percent in 2001. But the data didn't split out yard sign from open houses.
McClelland's brokerage finds open houses so important that the company organizes a monthly Super Sunday and heavily promotes all the open houses via advertising and social media , even having a drawing for $1,000 for one lucky visitor. The firm also developed an in-house training course on doing an effective open house.
""It's really evolved over the past seven to 10 years,"" McClelland says. A decade ago, visitors had questions about neighborhoods and schools. Most buyers today have answered those questions with Internet research and are ready to see specific homes.
""Now they come in much further down that sales cycle where they're more ready to draw up a contract,"" Craig says. ""They already know everything about the neighborhood.""
But Kudrna sees more open house visitors from early in the sales cycle – people who are looking for homes but haven't narrowed down their options enough to be ready to buy.
""All of the open houses I do, the majority of the people are neighbors,"" Kudrna says. Not everyone sees that as a negative, since neighbors may share details about the home with friends and family looking to buy or become clients of the agent later – though that may not help the current sellers. Critics of open houses have long argued that the true beneficiary of an open house is the real estate agent, who can meet new clients.
Kudrna deals with a lot of buyers who are relocating and searching from afar. For those clients, he does personal tours via FaceTime or Skype. Even for local buyers, the photos and virtual tours provided with many listings may take the place of Sunday drives through neighborhoods, he believes.",0.9803,0.13056063278285493,-0.05555555555555555

Yemen War Fought By Children? Minors Fight Battles, Man Checkpoints As Saudi-Led Coalition Battles Houthi Rebels
http://www.ibtimes.com/yemen-war-fought-children-minors-fight-battles-man-checkpoints-saudi-led-coalition-2136357
Children constitute roughly one-third of the fighters in Yemen, according to a United Nations official cited by Gulf News Sunday. The official said a growing number of children have been pulled into the conflict as it has intensified in recent months.
“We are seeing children in battle, at checkpoints and, unfortunately, among [those] killed and injured,” Julien Harneis, Unicef’s representative in Yemen, reportedly said during a stop in Geneva.
Exactly how many children are fighting in Yemen is hard to determine, but officials estimated about 30 percent of the fighters in armed groups were minors. The U.N. documented the recruitment in 2013 of 106 children, some as young as 6 years old, but indicated the comparable number may have risen sharply since then.
Child soldiers were reportedly particularly visible among Houthi factions, as children were spotted guarding buildings and manning checkpoints. At least 77 children have been killed in fighting since the country spiraled into a civil war in March, but Harneis said the conflict-related deaths among children were likely much higher than has been reported.
A child soldier is defined by international law as any person below 18 years old who has been used by armed groups for any purpose, including not only as fighters but also as cooks, sexual partners and spies. There are an estimated 250,000 child soldiers in the world today, according to War Child, an advocacy group that provides support for children in war.
Groups fighting in Yemen — encompassing the Houthi fighters believed to be backed by Iran and the Saudi-led coalition opposing them — have repeatedly been accused of committing human-rights violations that some have alleged amount to war crimes. Fighting has intensified as Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies have sought to bolster the Yemeni government, which lost control of much of the country in March. The government has regained its grip over a number of key areas in recent months, but the rebels have maintained their hold over much of the nation.",-0.9964,0.008653846153846153,-0.3076923076923077

Reuters | Galle, October 17, 2015 | UPDATED 15:37 IST Mail A+ A- Rangana Herath claimed his fifth 10-wicket haul in Tests. (AP Photo) 
Sri Lanka needed less than four days to thrash West Indies by an innings and six runs in the opening Test at Galle on Saturday with Rangana Herath leading the victory charge by claiming his fifth 10-wicket haul. 
The touring side were bundled out for 227 in their second innings in the afternoon session, after being asked to follow on by the hosts. 
Herath added three wickets to his previous day's removal of opener Kraigg Brathwaite (34) after taking six wickets in the first innings. He finished with match figures of 10 for 147. 
Debutant allrounder Milinda Siriwardana and paceman Dhammika Prasad picked up two wickets apiece in the second innings for Sri Lanka. Jermaine Blackwood played some delightful shots and showed nimble footwork against the spinners during his knock of 92, his second highest score in Tests, but was the last man out. 
After resuming on 67 for 2, West Indies lost nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo (10) in wily left-arm spinner Herath's third over and then experienced batsman Marlon Samuels was out lbw off the first ball he faced. 
Samuels did not offer a shot to a straight delivery and more surprisingly, decided to waste a review by challenging the umpire's decision. The bowler's hat-trick ball was fended away by Blackwood. 
West Indies' hopes of avoiding a heavy defeat rested on Darren Bravo (31), who scored a 50 in the first innings, but the left-hander edged Nuwan Pradeep behind after captain Angelo Mathews' decision to allow the paceman one more over was vindicated. 
Blackwood and wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin (11) stitched together a dogged 48-run stand for the sixth wicket before Siriwardena ended the pair's resistance when Ramdin edged a catch to Kaushal Silva at second slip.

Houston Texans owner Bob McNair made a $10,000 donation this week to a local group that is advocating against LGBTQ rights. 
Hillary Clinton's campaign hit Republican rival Rand Paul on Wednesday for a comment he made earlier in the day about gay rights in the workplace. 
The libertarian-leaning Paul, who is skeptical of more government regulations on business conduct, said ... More 
The Campaign for Houston has been trying to take down the anti-discrimination proposition known as Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), or Proposition 1. 
The ordinance would prohibit discrimination of any kind based on sex, race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, age, martial status, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. 
McNair has a net worth of $3.3. billion, and brought football's Texans to Houston after the Oilers left. His contribution to the Campaign comes as the National Football League has made strides to accept gay players. 
The league drafted its first openly gay player, Michael Sam, in February 2014. And players such as Andrew Luck and Chris Kluwe have been vocal about welcoming gay players to the league. 
Campaign for Houston spokesman Jared Woodfill confirmed Friday that McNair sent the check to the group, which says the ordinance is ""an attack on the traditional family."" 
""We're very excited,"" he said. ""Obviously it speaks volumes to the support we have if a hero like McNair is contributing to our campaign."" 
Proponents of HERO have said that Houston will lose the privilege of hosting the Super Bowl in 2017 if it doesn't pass. 
Woodfill said that argument was ""bogus."" 
The Campaign for Houston has also received support from former Houston Astros outfielder Lance Berkman. 
HERO was pushed by Mayor Annise Parker, who was elected as Houston's first openly gay mayor in 2009. 
The proposition will come to a vote on Nov. 3.",0.9853,0.2130456349206349,0.058823529411764705

Comment By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Wicked Local By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 8:39 PM Updated at 8:39 PM By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 8:39 PM NORWOOD — Like clockwork, the Natick football team practices its two-minute drill each week. Although the Redhawks offense works to execute the crucial component of the game, the unit never really knows when it will have to be utilized in a game situation. On Saturday afternoon, however, when Natick traveled to Norwood to take on the Mustangs in a Bay State Conference bout between Herget Division rivals, the practice paid off. After Norwood kicked a 31-yard field goal to take a three-point lead with 2:47 remaining in the fourth quarter, Natick strung together a 13-play, 70-yard scoring drive to escape with a 21-17 victory once sophomore running back Malik Williams plunged in for a one-yard touchdown run with nine seconds left in the game. “I trusted my offensive line, I knew that anything we did, we’d get in there behind those guys,” said Williams, who was stopped at the line of scrimmage before keeping his feet moving for the go-ahead score. “When I got stopped, I just heard my dad in my ear saying, ‘Keep going. Keep driving and moving your feet.’ I just kept going until I made it over the goal line.” Although Williams secured the win for Natick (3-4, 2-3 BSC), the Redhawks had to execute on more than the final play of the drive to outlast Norwood (3-4, 2-3 BSC). After sophomore quarterback Christian D’Antonio completed a 19-yard pass to senior Jared Abbruzzese on third-and-10, the Redhawks benefited from a Mustangs roughing the passer penalty which advanced the ball to Norwood’s 35 yard line with 2:02 remaining. Once more, the offense overcame adversity when D’Antonio completed a 16-yard pass to sophomore Peter Ryan on fourth-and-16. That completion gave Natick a first-and-10 from the Mustangs 21-yard line with 1:22 left. After four straight runs by Williams — who finished with 74 yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries — advanced the ball to the 2-yard line, Abbruzzese was stopped short at the 1 with 13 seconds to play. On the next play, though, Williams fought his way into the end zone for a 20-17 lead. “That final drive was huge,” Natick coach Mark Mortarelli said. “(Falling behind) was tough, but I was really proud of the way we responded on that final drive. A lot of guys made a lot of plays, it was a hard-fought win and we needed it.” After Williams and Abbruzzese each had first-half touchdown runs to give Natick a 14-0 lead at halftime, Norwood battled back to score 17 unanswered points. The Mustangs only needed 3:26 to travel 77 yards on seven plays on their opening possession of the half, as senior running back Joseph Mazzotta broke loose for a 28-yard touchdown run which cut the Redhawks lead to 14-7 with 8:26 left in the third. Page 2 of 2 - Norwood took over following a fumbled snap on Natick’s ensuing possession, and once again the Mustangs quickly moved the ball down the field with another scoring drive. The team’s senior quarterback Joe Leanos threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to a wide open Zac Pungitore, which, after a made extra-point by freshman Jay Wladkowski, tied the game 14-14 with 11:54 remaining in the final quarter. D’Antonio was intercepted by senior Adley Eugene on Natick’s ensuing drive, as Norwood used 6:24 before Wladkowski gave the Mustangs their first lead of the game with his 31-yard field goal. “The second half we played well and that’s something we can build off,” Norwood coach Jim Tighe said. “But that’s happened to us before this year, so we have to learn that we have to play a little bit better in the first half. If we put two halves together we could be tough to beat, but we haven’t been able to do that.” Although Saturday’s win should be enough to propel Natick into the playoffs, Mortarelli said he was unsure of who or when his team will play next. All that was important to the team’s players was securing a victory, and Abbruzzese was happy to see the practice paid off. “We practice two-minute drills all the time and we finally used it,” said the senior, who rushed for 36 yards and caught 65 more. “We actually had one at the beginning of the year that we almost finished, but this one was perfect. Everything went right, we executed every play.” By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Wicked Local By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 8:39 PM",0.9881,0.07678369424692953,-0.0625

Doug Cook The Daily Courier PRESCOTT VALLEY - Bradshaw Mountain High's football team remained in contention with Prescott and Mingus Union in the Division III, Section VIII title race on Friday, Oct. 16, roughing up Coconino, 56-22, at a rain-soaked Bob Pavlich Field on Senior Night.With the rivalry game against the Badgers looming Friday, Oct. 23, at Bill Shepard Field, the D-III No. 14 Bears took care of business behind senior tailback/defensive back Angel Gonzalez, who had a 99-yard kickoff return, an 11-yard TD run and a 56-yard TD pass.""He's a kid with a lot of heart - physical, quick kid,"" Bradshaw coach David Moran said of Gonzalez, one of his co-captains. ""He's going to play college football somewhere someday. He's just a good leader. And when we need the play to be made, he makes the play for you.""Two-time defending section champion Bradshaw (6-2 overall, 2-1 section) has now won two straight in Section VIII after suffering a 20-15 loss to No. 11 Mingus in its league opener Oct. 2 in Cottonwood. No. 36 Coconino (3-6, 0-3) has lost three in a row, all in section.In other section action Friday, No. 17 Prescott was upset by No. 30 Flagstaff, 36-6, dropping the Badgers' league record to 2-1. Prescott is now tied with Bradshaw for second place, while 2-0 Mingus stayed atop the heap. The Marauders took a brief break from section play this week to face McClintock in Tempe.Versus Coconino, Bradshaw trailed 13-0 midway through the first quarter before bouncing back in a big way. Gonzalez lit an immediate spark for the Bears on his kickoff return with 6:06 left in the opening period.""There was great blocking everywhere, and then smart of (our guys) not hitting people late once I passed them and let me do my thing,"" Gonzalez said of his runback. ""But it wasn't just me. It was everyone involved. The team, the sideline, the crowd - they did it all.""Quarterback Gunner Bundrick followed Gonzalez's key special teams play with a 12-yard TD run and a 2-point conversion run with a minute left in the first quarter to hand Bradshaw the lead for good, up 14-13.Leading only 28-20 at halftime, the Bears put the game on ice in the third quarter, however, outscoring Coconino 21-2 for a 49-22 advantage going into the fourth.""Our kids came out and played hard, and played physical, and played fast,"" Moran said. ""At halftime we just talked about playing our game, playing at our level. In the third quarter, we played at that level.""David Otero began the third with a 38-yard TD run on a triple reverse. The play began with Bundrick, who handed off the ball to Gonzalez, who then gave it to Derrik Fabela. Otero came back to the left side for the ball and sprinted to pay dirt.Up 35-20 at that point, Bradshaw forced a turnover on Coco's next possession. Bears defensive lineman John Trout scooped up a fumble by Coco QB Cristo Tabares after the Bears' Dylan Wallace stripped Tabares in the backfield. Trout got the ball around the Coco 25 and ran in for a TD and a 42-20 Bradshaw lead with 10 minutes left in the third.""My coach said, 'Get to the gap, rip through,' "" Trout said of his play on the fumble. ""All I remember is ripping through, seeing the ball and thinking 'palms up, pick it and run.' I though the whistle had blown. I stopped and then I kept going.""The Bears' Brevin Moser intercepted a pass on Coco's next possession, setting up Bradshaw's third and final TD of the quarter, a 13-yard pass from Bundrick to Brandon Comeno, who atoned for two earlier dropped balls.Friday's game was chock full of penalties and hard hits - a good, old-fashioned league tilt - in off-and-on, soaking rain and chilly temps.Next Friday, Bradshaw's focus shifts entirely to Prescott. If the Bears don't beat their chief rival, they will be eliminated from section title contention. If Bradshaw wins, it would need Prescott to beat Mingus in Week 10 at home to have a shot at its third straight section crown.Kickoff for the Bradshaw-Prescott game is scheduled for 7 p.m. Oct. 23.""Right now we're looking at Prescott next week, and that's all we're concerned about,"" Moran added. ""As far as the section championship goes, that's going to play out itself, and we've just got to take care of business on our end. You never know what's going to happen.""",0.9931,0.02713417658730158,-0.25
45,Ranji Trophy: Karun Nair hits ton as Karnataka take 1st innings vs Bengal,"Bengaluru : Upcoming talent Karun Nair made a mincemeat of Bengal bowling with a crushing century as defending champions Karnataka comfortably took the first innings lead against Bengal in a Ranji Trophy group league encounter, in Bengaluru, on Friday.
In reply to Bengal's first innings score of 312, Karnataka riding on Karun's unbeaten 119 reached 322 for four in 83 overs at stumps on the second day.
Karun was involved in two crucial partnerships --- 114 for the third wicket with Manish Pandey (53) and 113 for the unbroken fifth wicket stand with all-rounder Shreyas Gopal (54 batting).
Karun, who was recently called up as a reserve for the India Test team hit 18 boundaries in 173 balls as Karnataka scored runs at a rate of close to four runs per pver. The two senior most bowlers in the Bengal line-up --- pacer Ashoke Dinda (1/61 in 15 overs) and left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha (1/95 in 23 overs) were the offenders.
While Dinda's propensity to bowl short cost Bengal dearly, it was clear from Ojha's performance that he is well past his best as neither did he get any appreciable turn nor zip from the Chinnaswamy track. He often bowled short as Karun, Pandey and Gopal took full advantage of those bad deliveries.
While Dinda provided an early breakthrough removing Robin Uthappa (3) cheaply, Ravi Kumar Samarth (30) and Shishir Bhavane (32) added 51 for the second wicket before Samarth edged one off Veer Pratap Singh to Wriddhiman Saha, behind the stumps.
Bhavane was retired hurt in the 27th over after which Karun and Pandey joined forces to flay the Bengal attack. It was Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who removed Pandey caught by Shreevats Goswami while CM Gautham was snapped by Ojha. But that was the end of tne joy for Bengal as their bowlers then lacked penetration to get Karnataka batsmen out.
With a fragile batting line-up at its disposal, there is every possibility of an outright defeat for Manoj Tiwary and his biys in case Karnataka get a lead in excess of 150.
Brief Scores: Bengal 312 in 88.2 overs (Sudeep Chatterjee 145, Wriddhiman Saha 90, R Vinay Kumar 4/80)

47,Steelers rally around Jones; Cardinals sloppy in loss,"Steelers find unlikely hero in third-string QB Landry Jones, rally past messy Cardinals By WILL GRAVES AP Sports Writer   1:54   1:54   
Pennsylvania (896) 

PITTSBURGH — Le'Veon Bell wondered. Martavis Bryant wondered. Heck, even Landry Jones kind of wondered how he'd do after spending the entirety of his two-plus seasons in the NFL either holding a clipboard or dressed in sweats on gameday. 
Then all that time spent in meetings trying to absorb everything he could from Ben Roethlisberger started to pay off. Replacing injured Michael Vick in the third quarter against Arizona on Sunday, Jones did his best to mimic his mentor. He relaxed. He called out the signals. And he played. 
The first touchdown pass of Jones' NFL career gave the Steelers confidence. The second provided the clincher in a 25-13 victory. 
""He was like Ben's little brother out there,"" Bell said. ""He was out there making checks and everything and it brought us back like 'Dang, Landry really got this."" 
Did he ever. 
Jones completed 8 of 12 passes for 168 yards and the two scores — both to Martavis Bryant — as Pittsburgh (4-2) scored rallied from a seven-point halftime deficit. The Steelers improved to 2-1 without Roethlisberger, who missed his third straight game with a sprained left knee. Roethlisberger will practice this week before Pittsburgh heads to Kansas City, though Jones' surprisingly steady play showed the Steelers can be dynamic even with their captain on the sideline. 
""I just still can't believe I got in the game and to play,"" Jones said. ""I'm still reeling from it."" 
Hard to blame he. He was a star in college at Oklahoma, where he didn't miss a game in four years. The Steelers took him in the fourth round of the 2013 draft but he did little with the opportunity, scuffling during training camp and the preseason and unable to supplant Bruce Gradkowski or Vick as the primary backup to Roethlisberger. 
Funny, he looked right at home after stepping in for Vick, who was ineffective before pulling up at the end of a scramble in the third quarter. Jones threw high to Bryant in the back of the end zone to give the Steelers the lead and he later found Bryant for an 88-yard catch-and-run. 
""I'm just so thankful they gave me a shot,"" Jones said. ""They just didn't hand the ball left and right off the bat. They let me get out there and throw."" 
Jones can make plays in the NFL. Some other things to take from Pittsburgh's second win in six days. 
NOT SO HAPPY HOMECOMING: Arizona coach Bruce Arians was let go as Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator after the 2011 season in a move he jokingly called a ""refirement."" Back at Heinz Field for the first time as a head coach, Arians' team looked like one of the NFL's best during long stretches but struggled to finish drives. The Cardinals (4-2) turned it over three times, including two in the second half that lead to Pittsburgh touchdowns. 
CAM CAN: Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward wore eye black with ""Ironhead"" written on them to honor his late father Craig ""Ironhead"" Heyward, who played 11 seasons in the NFL but passed away in 2006 after a long fight with cancer. Heyward was fined $5,787 by the league last week for the tribute. He expects to receive another one but considers it money well spent. ""I don't want to ruffle any feathers but this is bigger than all we play for,"" Heyward said. ""There are people fighting for (their) lives."" 
BIG DAYS BUT ... : Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer threw for 421 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. John Brown caught 10 passes for 196 yards but also fumbled in the third quarter to set up a Pittsburgh touchdown. Arizona came in as the NFL's highest scoring team but found the end zone just once on four red zone possessions. 
INJURIES: The Steelers lost left tackle Kelvin Beachum for the season with a torn ACL in his left knee. Beachum was replaced by Alejandro Villanueva, a former Army Ranger who caught on with the Steelers as a practice squad player last year. Arizona tight end Darren Fells left with a shoulder injury and did not return. 
NEXT UP: Pittsburgh faces the struggling Chiefs (1-5), though it's unclear who will be at quarterback. Roethlisberger was limited in practice last week and Vick's status is uncertain. ""I want complete clarity, but I don't always get what I want,"" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. ... The Cardinals host Baltimore.

Associated Press SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - California has passed a law requiring local law enforcement to provide paperwork for immigrant crime victims applying for visas to remain in the country legally so long as they are otherwise eligible for the federal government program.
The law signed by Gov. Jerry Brown is the first such statewide measure aimed at making it easier for victims of crimes including rape and domestic violence to apply for the visas.
Until now, some law enforcement have provided immigrants with the required paperwork documenting the crime and their assistance with an investigation, while others have been loath to do so.
Advocates say they hope the new law will address the discrepancy. It is one of a spate of measures enacted in California this year to help immigrants in the country illegally.",-0.9118,-0.023376623376623377,-0.4

Lionel Messi and father Lionel Messi will have to stand trial for tax fraud after the state lawyer representing Spain's Inland Revenue successfully argued that both the player's father Jorge Horracio and the player himself should be called to take the stand. 
Messi's father has always maintained his son plays no part in the management of his money but that will now be decided by a judge with Messi called to give evidence in a court case for which a date has still not been set. 
The state lawyer has called for sentences of 22 months for both Messi and his father although even in the case of both men being found guilty the sentence is likely to be suspended in view of it being a first offence. 
The pair are accused of using a chain of fake companies in Belize and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on â‚¬4.16million (£2.72m) of Messi's income earned through the sale of his image rights during the tax years 2007, 2008 and 2009. 
The 'Messis' have since cleared their tax debt which will reduce any subsequent sentence. 
During the three years in question Messi signed contracts with Banc Sabadell, Telefonica, Danone, Air Europa, Adidas and Pepsi for the combined sum of â‚¬10m (£7.3m) but no tax in Spain was originally paid on them. 
The Messi family had an appeal to try only father Jorge turned down last October. They claimed that Messi left all commercial business to his father and had not dedicated 'even a minute' of his life to reading or analysing it.",-0.9834,0.01688034188034188,-0.5555555555555556

In a historic game between longtime rivals, John Lackey outdueled former teammate Jon Lester in a classic pitcher's duel, firing 7 1/3 scoreless innings Friday night as the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Chicago Cubs for a 1-0 lead in their best-of-five National League Division Series. Mariners part with manager McClendon 
Lackey, who had teamed with Lester for three wins as the Boston Red Sox vanquished St. Louis in the 2013 World Series, combined with two relievers for a two-hitter. He allowed both hits and a walk and had five strikeouts. 
Chicago didn't manage a hit until shortstop Addison Russell grounded a leadoff single to center in the sixth.Russell reached third with two outs, but center fielder Dexter Fowler's towering fly ball was gloved by right fielder Randal Grichuk at the wall, ending the Cubs' best scoring threat. 
After the first inning, Lester matched Lackey pitch for pitch until the Cardinals put it away with a one-out power display in the eighth. 
Pinch-hitter Tommy Pham belted a 431-foot homer in his first postseason at-bat. After a walk to third baseman Matt Carpenter that ended Lester's outing, right fielder Stephen Piscotty greeted reliever Pedro Strop with a two-run homer to the seats in left. 
Lester struck out nine in 7 1/3 innings, allowing three runs, five hits and a walk. 
The first-ever playoff game between the NL Central rivals attracted a crowd of 47,830, the second largest in Busch Stadium III history. 
St. Louis initiated the scoring in the bottom of the first as a playoff newbie and a veteran produced the run. Piscotty slapped a ground-rule double to right with one out and scored as left fielder Matt Holliday lined a single to center. 
The Cardinals had other chances to add to their lead but stranded three men at second in the first four innings. 
Lester fanned eight in the first five innings, including shortstop Jhonny Peralta and Grichuk twice apiece. Lackey sailed through the first five innings, facing the minimum number of hitters and allowed just one batter to reach base. 
Right fielder Kyle Schwarber walked with one out in the fourth, but third baseman Kris Bryant rapped into a 5-4-3 double play on the first pitch.",0.9382,0.06854166666666665,0.13333333333333333

(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- For the first time since 2010, the Miller Lady Cardinals claimed the Class 1 District 8 title by defeating the two-time defending champion Billings Lady Wildcats, 25-23, 25-19. In front of a raucous home crowd, the Cardinals overcame an early deficit to win the first set. Trailing 13-7 and with the momentum waning, head coach Tamra Landers called a time out. The Cardinals responded by scoring seven of the next nine points to put them down, 15-14. The game remained tight as the score was tied five times before Landers called her second time out with the score 22-22. Miller finished the game strong and won, 25-23. Miller’s defense took the best Billings had to offer and was able to control the Wildcats’ outside hitters. Led by sophomore libero Lynna Hadlock, Miller’s defense was stifling. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE GAME “Our libero is amazing,” said Landers. “I think she missed one early, then she made that slight adjustment to get squared up and nothing got past her. Everything was almost a perfect dig every time. It’s amazing because I have a freshman middle, sophomore libero, sophomore outside, and three seniors. We’re pretty young but they just wanted it, they really wanted it.”“I just got there,” said Hadlock. “I listened to my coach and I got to the deep corner where I needed to be. We haven’t won a district title in the last five years so it feels great to win. The seniors on this team are amazing, they keep us all up. I’m just so happy we won.” In the second set, Miller never trailed and steadily increased their lead to 18-13, but the Wildcats continued to fight back. Every loose ball seemed to go Miller’s way. With Miller leading 23-16, the Wildcats’ last surge gave them 19 points but they ran out of time. They were unable to stop the Cardinals. Miller senior Jessica Estes led the Cardinals in blocks and kills.“We’ve taken strides, we’ve learned how to hit, and we’ve learned how to pass,” said Estes. “We’ve learned how to work as a team, most importantly. To beat a team that has won two district titles back-to-back is so big for us. Our defense was amazing. They had a very good hitter but Lynna, one of the very best liberos in the conference, was able to dig everything for us. We rely more on defense than big hits because we play as a team.”“We played hard, but it seemed like they dug up almost every single ball that we hit at them,” said Billings coach Brittany Cheek. “We had a game plan coming in, I thought we executed it well, Miller just played with passion. After the game I told them to keep their heads up, not one single person lost the game for us. I thanked the seniors for their six years of service and that I was just proud of them. Miller is a very good team and congratulations to them.”“I knew these girls could do it,” said Landers. “It came down to heart and we had a lot of it. We’ve been having some really good, hard practices and these girls had made a goal to win the district. They’ve stuck together. Our motto this year is “sisterhood” and they played like sisters.

52,Texas Instruments Results Exceed Expectations,"By Chelsey Dulaney
Texas Instruments Inc. on Wednesday reported stronger-than-expected profit and revenue for its third quarter and offered upbeat guidance for its current quarter.
Shares of the Dallas-based company jumped 8.6% in after-hours trading.
Texas Instruments, which initially focused on reflection seismography for the oil industry, has been moving away from digital chips to focus on analog chips, which often command lower prices but can be produced with older equipment at a high profit. TI has struggled recently with lackluster demand for personal electronics, particularly PCs, and communications equipment.
In the latest quarter, sales in both the analog segment and the embedded processing segment, which includes processors and microcontrollers, grew 2%.
Overall, TI reported a profit of $798 million, down from $826 million a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings were flat at 76 cents on fewer shares outstanding.

53,"Sharing information is key to halting cyber attacks in coming Interent of Things era, says Tom Ridge.","Stopping cyberattacks in the coming era of the Internet of Things will require better information sharing between government and the private sector, said former Homeland Security head Tom Ridge on Thursday in San Diego.
""We still don’t have that public-private partnership,"" said Ridge at CyberFest 2015. ""You do have information-sharing analysis centers, but we have a long way to go before we minimize risk.""
Ridge, a former Republican congressman, was the first Homeland Security Department Secretary under President George W. Bush. He and current business partner Howard Schmidt, a former cyberadviser to President Obama, answered questions about the current state of cyberthreats at the CyberFest conference organized by the nonprofit Securing our eCity Foundation.
CyberFest’s focus was security of The Internet of Things. As many as 50 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet over the next decade, according to industry research firm idtechex.com. Not all of these gadgets will be powerful enough to provide a gateway for hackers to launch attacks. But billions of them will be, said Ridge.
""Everybody has a role to play in cybersecurity,"" he said. ""If everybody is connected, then at some point in time you have a role to play."" 
Ridge said government should share data about malware, precursors and cyberattacks with the private sector, and the private sector should share information about the attacks they’re experiencing with government.
For now, that’s not happening enough, he said. Part of the reason is businesses fear they’ll become targets of regulators.
""The Federal Trade Commission is fining companies who haven’t even been breached because somebody in government has decided that their security protocols aren’t good enough,"" said Ridge. ""Maybe the FTC should work with the OPM (U.S. Office of Personnel Management) before they start fining companies.""
In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management announced that it had suffered a data breach that may have exposed the records of about 20 million people, mostly current and former government employees.
Cyber attacks have grabbed headlines over the past few years, with high profile breaches at Target, Home Depot, Sony and elsewhere highlighting the growing threat.
A study by research firm Ponemon Institute found data breaches on average cost organizations $6.5 million in damages this year — up $600,000 from last year.
Ponemon only counts breaches where 100,000 or fewer records were compromised. Extreme breaches such as Target are excluded so they don’t skew the data.
Technology to identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks — called attribution — is getting better, said Ridge. While organized crime is behind some data breaches, nations also are believed to be behind several cyberattacks in the U.S. 
President Barack Obama has signed an executive that gives the government authority to respond to state-sponsored cyberhacks with sanctions or other measures, said Ridge.
""I think it is about time,"" he said. ""Until we push back, and I am going to leave it to the president to decide how we push back, they will keep doing it.""

54,Workers Today Should Embrace the 9-to-5 Workday,"Charles Bukowski was never really a billboard for good health. But it was not just the long nights spent drinking in rundown bars that were to blame. It was work.
In 1969, at the age of 49, he could finally stop working by the hour. In a letter to his publisher John Martin, who, by offering a monthly salary of $100, had made this transition possible, Bukowski described the terrible blow work had dealt him: “The color leaves the eye. The voice becomes ugly. And the body. The hair. The fingernails. The shoes.”
Bukowski wondered why anyone would agree to such humiliations, and was not alone in his skepticism. In his time, working 9-to-5 was a symbol for the inauthentic life, a constant and pointless shuttling between the office and the television set.
But Bukowski’s main concern was not that what the 9-to-5 workday symbolized, but that it always turned into something else. “They call it ‘9 to 5,’” he wrote in the letter to his publisher, already predicting that there would be worse things than an eight-hour workday. “It's never 9 to 5, there's no free lunch break at those places, in fact, at many of them in order to keep your job you don't take lunch. Then there's overtime and the books never seem to get the overtime right and if you complain about that, there's another sucker to take your place.”",-0.9209,-0.08515406162464986,-0.5625

60,Dallas-area companies in for long haul despite China turmoil,"As the Chinese government continues to take steps to stabilize its economy, U.S. companies that do business there are left to wonder what will come next.
At least two Texas companies are taking the long view.
Rich Templeton, chief executive of Texas Instruments Inc., said Tuesday that he’s not too worried about China because his company is in for the long haul. Roughly 44 percent of the Dallas-based semiconductor company’s total revenue comes from products shipped to China, including Hong Kong.
Despite the recent turmoil, Fossil Group Inc. CEO Kosta Kartsotis still sees great opportunity in China and Asia in general. The Richardson-based retailer generates more than half of its sales from outside the United States, including about 13 percent from the Asia Pacific region.
China has ranked as the world’s fastest-growing economy, but its growth is slowing. The Chinese government just reported that imports fell 13.8 percent in August, one day after it revised last year’s economic growth downward. The government has introduced a series of measures in recent weeks to stabilize its extremely volatile stock market, which has fallen by 40 percent since June.
Weakening growth in China, the world’s second largest economy, is one of several external forces that are playing havoc with businesses in Texas and across the country in terms of their revenue, profit margins and ability to give customers and investors a sense of what’s ahead.
They’ve also had to deal with low oil prices, a strong U.S. dollar and other global economic woes. Last week, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned that global growth will be weaker than expected.
More U.S. companies than ever are doing business overseas, so the potential impact of a global slowdown is greater. The 50 largest companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index collectively have seen their share of revenue from outside the United States increase from 42 percent in 2010 to 67 percent as of their last fiscal year, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.
“No chip company is going to be completely immune” to China’s slowdown, said Craig Ellis, a semiconductor analyst for B. Riley & Co. He predicts that China’s woes will contribute to a decline in total revenue for about 60 chip companies this quarter from a year earlier — the first quarterly drop in three years.
“We still believe that over a 10- to 20-year period that the Chinese economy will be larger than it is today,” Templeton said Tuesday at an industry conference in New York. TI, which entered China in 2010 and now operates three facilities there, remains focused on continuing to build long-term relationships there, he said.
Much of the watches, jewelry and other fashion accessories that Fossil sells are made or assembled in China, which means a large percentage of its distribution to customers is dependent on the health of its manufacturing sources and factories in China. In addition, Fossil operates offices in six other Asian countries.
“The MERS [Middle East respiratory syndrome] outbreak in South Korea and economic downturns affecting Hong Kong and Macao are putting pressure on our near-term results,” Kartsotis said last month in a conference call. “We also still have significant growth ahead of us internationally, with Asia representing our biggest opportunity by far.”

Hard-disk maker Seagate Technology Plc said it planned to cut 1,050 jobs, or 2 percent of its workforce, as part of a restructuring program. 
The company said on Thursday it expected to save about $113 million annually from the restructuring and incur pretax charges of about $53 million. ( 1.usa.gov/1LYRk4e ) 
Seagate, which has about 52,200 employees worldwide, expects to complete the restructuring by the end of the December quarter. The company expects to incur most of the pretax charges in the first quarter, it said. 
Seagate has reported a fall in sales for the past two quarters, hurt by weak demand from original equipment manufacturers, including PC makers. 
Research firm International Data Corp said last month that it expected a bigger drop in 2015 PC shipments than it had anticipated earlier due to a large inventory of notebooks and a strong dollar. 
To help make up for a declining PC market, Seagate and rival Western Digital Corp are expanding into the growing market for cloud data storage products. 
Seagate's shares ended at $50.10 on Wednesday. Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had fallen more than 24 percent this year.

62,Wolters Kluwer Financial Services Offers Four Tips Regarding New HMDA Rules,"Wolters Kluwer Financial Services Offers Four Tips Regarding New HMDA Rules [October 16, 2015] Tweet 
With the finalization of new Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data collection rules, Wolters Kluwer Financial Services today issued its HMDA Readiness Project Plan tool to help lenders prepare for the enormity of change that the new rules entail. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released final rules that mandate the collection of a significant number of new and changed data fields. 
According to the company's regulatory compliance experts, the extent and breadth of the required new fields will have considerable ramifications for financial institutions. 
""Collecting, analyzing and reporting the additional data fields now required under the law will bring significant technology, operational, staffing, and regulatory change management challenges for lenders,"" said Timothy R. Burniston , executive vice president, Wolters Kluwer Financial Services. ""Our first order of business will be to work closely with lenders to help them understand the scope of these changes and possible implications for their businesses, as well as to guide them on meaningful steps they can proactively take to prepare for the required changes and to improve their analysis of mortgage lending data."" 
While the new rules are effective January 1, 2018-with reporting of the newly finalized 2018 data fields by March 1, 2019-the company encourages lenders to initiate enterprise planning and readiness efforts early to best position them for complying with the new regulation requirements, including: 
1) Identify all lines of business that will be impacted by the HMDA changes . Develop a working group of affected business lines and departments-including mortgage lending, information technology, and compliance-to determine how best to organize, coordinate and align these groups' activities. 
2) Develop an implementation plan . Assign roles and accountabilities within the working group to ensure that individuals responsible for implementation are connected and developing a plan of action. 
3) Identify and prepare for any needed staff training and technology investments . Determine the enterprise methodoloy and approach. Begin to source and plan for the new HMDA changes. Outline the timeline and cost of the changes. 
4) Strengthen and bolster the organization's analytical capabilities. In addition to collecting and submitting quality data, lenders need to know what the implications of the data are for their institution. Analytics will be key to finding indications of potential disparate treatment or impact of protected classes, and an essential step in being able to conduct root cause analyses to determine the extent of problems-and providing a pathway for addressing them. 
Wolters Kluwer Financial Services recommends that organizations use the HMDA Readiness Project Plan tool to help aid their initial organizational assessments and planning. 
""Meeting the new HMDA requirements will be facilitated more readily for those organizations that have a strong compliance foundation in place,"" said Burniston. ""Given that the transition time for managing a regulatory change of this magnitude can never really be sufficient, lenders should take the long view and manage the time available to position their organization for a successful transition.""

63,Rumor: Samsung Galaxy S7 to be announced in January?,"By Android Authority
Published October 23, 2015 File photo - Feb. 26, 2013: A view of the visitors in the stand of Samsung at the Mobile World Congress, in Barcelona, Spain. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)
Rumors about the Galaxy S7 have been circulating since Samsung’s current smartphone hit stores – if not earlier – and while most have been seemingly based on sheer conjecture or else not worth repeating, the latest offerings seem a bit more believable. Korean news outlet ETNews is reporting that the new super smartphone will make its official debut in January – possibly the 19th – and that there should be both a “premium” and a “sub-premium” variant.
SamMobile had previously reported that this dual dichotomy is going to be a follow-up to the S6 and S6 Edge; the SM-G930 being the standard-affair offering, and the SM-G935 featuring the OEM’s iconic curved display.
Also mentioned in today’s rumor report is a claim that “ Project Lucky ” will use an ePoP chip to integrate all the necessary sensor components on a single die, an engineering strategy employed by the S6 to help improve efficiency.
Spec-wise, the details are somewhat confusing. There may be several different processor variants depending on the market the S7 is sold in, and the flagship smartphone may use a pressure-sensitive display technology similar to what Apple has started marketing. Also slated are USB Type-C support and even a dual-camera arrangement with a brand new 20-megapixel primary sensor.
As with all rumors, this piece should not be considered as factual until Samsung so speaketh. The specs could change, and the product launch could even be held later than the typical MWC-debut. Just a few weeks back, some were claiming the S7 would be announced in December, for reference. Still, given the strategic decision to launch the Galaxy Note 5 (and S6 Edge+ ) earlier than usual, anything is possible.

64,Uber attracts late night passengers in St. Louis debut,"Uber attracts late night passengers in St. Louis debut September 22, 2015 by Lisa Brown, St. Louis Post-Dispatch 
Thousands of passengers turned to Uber for rides to and from their homes and workplaces over the weekend as the rival to taxicabs debuted UberX in St. Louis in defiance of regulators. 
More than 40 percent of the 5,000 local UberX trips logged from Friday through Sunday came during peak bar times - between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. - indicating the service was used by people who wanted to avoid driving drunk, Uber said Monday. 
Launched in 2010 in San Francisco, where the company is based, Uber has long sought to offer its UberX service in St. Louis but has faced opposition from the St. Louis Metropolitan Taxi Commission. UberX allows customers to use a smartphone app to connect with one of UberX's private drivers for a ride in the driver's vehicle. 
Friday, the St. Louis Metropolitan Taxi Commission approved the ability of ride-hailing services as long a criminal background check is conducted on the driver that includes fingerprinting - a measure Uber says is too onerous. Instead, Uber contends its $1 million commercial liability policy for every ride is sufficient, in addition to conducting background checks that screen for traffic violations and criminal history. 
UberX began operating Friday morning in St. Louis and St. Louis County without complying with the commission's fingerprint requirement. The company joined with riders in filing a federal lawsuit on the same day alleging antitrust violations. A judge denied a request by Uber and the plaintiffs that sought a temporary restraining order to allow UberX to operate for two weeks without commission regulations. 
Uber General Manager Sagar Shah said the weekend exceeded expectations. 
""It was incredible to see the positivity and response from the community,"" Shah said, adding that about 1,900 local drivers have passed background checks. 
Uber's decision to launch in St. Louis is opposed by some local taxi companies. Adam McNutt, president of Laclede Cab Co., said UberX launching operations locally without paying licensing fees is unfair. ""It definitely puts us at a competitive disadvantage, McNutt said. 
Laclede Cab has 174 permits for its taxi drivers who operate as independent contractors, and McNutt said the company plans to seek more permits. 
Laclede Cab's business wasn't negatively affected over the weekend as UberX debuted,"" McNutt said. ""We were busy,"" he said. ""At least as of now, we haven't seen an impact from Uber."" 
Laclede Cab added an app several years ago which has grown to account for 20 percent of its business. ""People have gotten used to that, and we had a lot of customers using our app before Uber came here,"" McNutt said. 
In response to criticism over not paying the same fees as taxi companies, Uber's Shah said its drivers are part-time, with most offering their services for six hours or fewer per week. ""It's inherently different that the existing taxi model,"" Shah said. 
St. Louis marks the first antitrust legal action the company has pursued. ""We're very confident in our case, and this is not something we're taking lightheartedly,"" Shah said.",-0.9351,0.030645161290322583,-0.08333333333333333

66,"Rich kid has gold Amex, private jet flights, and attitude to match | The","In an anonymous interview with Hamptons publication The Daily Summer , the tween boasts about a lifetime of weekends spent escaping the Manhattan rat race and catching a break in the luxurious beachside town.
Seriously, this kid makes Suri Cruise look like Pollyanna. Here are the 10 most ridiculous Quote: s from the piece.
1. He loves expensive gadgets
“’What’s the latest must-have item in your circle of friends?,” the interviewer asks. “The Apple Watch!,” he replies. “There are also these model Ferrari toy cars that race up to 40mph [64km/h].”
2. He has a nanny, who sounds like she has a pretty tough gig.
“My mum has promised me that my nanny will be with me until I go to college. I’m not sure what happens to her then, but we don’t really talk about it. She started when I was 2. I had a few before her.
“When she picks me up, she has to bring my phone. Every day she has to charge my phone to 99 per cent; I don’t want to overcharge it. She stays with me when my mom is away. I’m a little bit demanding and picky. I’m specific about my food. If the cherry has something in it, like a seed, I don’t want it. I like everything in order. My nanny is also the only person who can touch my gadgets, because she cleans up my room. She also organises my colognes and combs.”
3. He gets a pretty sweet allowance.
“It’s $US350 ($AU467) a month, but if I run out, I’ve memorised my mom’s credit card number so I’m covered.” His ideal allowance? “About $US700 ($AU935) a month seems fair.”
4. His favourite restaurant is super fancy.
“I just tried Beautique , which I’d recommend. I had the filet mignon. Every morning we go to the Golden Pear for an iced coffee.”
5. He is a strange child-grown-up hybrid.
“I don’t really do kid activities. I’m interested in technology and computers. I enjoy going to polo with my dad. I consider myself a kidult.” Wondering what that is exactly? “A kid who acts like an adult.”
6. His only career goal is to be super rich.
“An entrepreneur who creates my own technology company and then sells it. My friends want to be pilots, astronauts, politicians, typical stuff.”
7. He’s got game when it comes to the ladies (or so he says).
“I’m a popular guy. I get prank called a lot. Most of my friends don’t date. I get followed a lot by girls. Like, literally — they follow me around and try to touch me.”
8. He travels in style.
“I’ve flown to the Hamptons on a private jet, which was pretty cool, though I’m not a big fan of small planes. I’ll stay with the Jitney for now.”
9. He has his own credit card.
“I have a Gold AmEx. Sometimes at stores they question me, like when I was buying chocolate recently, and they looked to my nanny to see if she was going to pay, but I gave them my credit card and they said, ‘Aren’t you a little young for this?’”
10. We’ve saved the best for last. The most fascinating person he’s ever met? Kim Kardashian’s best friend, Jonathan Cheban.
“It was really, really cool. He was eating at 75 Main, and his security was there; there was a group of seven teenage girls who wanted his picture. He looks really different in person. My idol, though, is Scott Disick. He’s really cool. He’s the whole package. He has cars. Lots of them.”

67,Dreamliner deliveries delayed,"  
By Prof. Wolfgang H. Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 04, 2015 eTN   
There is intense speculation among aviation pundits that delayed deliveries – there is also another Boeing B737-800NG SkyInterior due later this year – may be tied to the success of disposing of the four Boeing B777-200s which have been earmarked for sale by this African airline. 
There have in fact been some suggestions that converting the purchase agreements into operating leases may also have taken longer than anticipated even though Dreamliner number seven’s purchase agreement had been altered into a long-term lease. 
It was confirmed that the delivery dates for the remaining two B787 Dreamliners for Kenya Airways (KQ) have been pushed further ahead, although both aircraft are reportedly ready for delivery and are now parked at the Boing assembly plant. Both aircraft were initially due for delivery and integration into the fleet by September this year. 
Being singled out for blame over last financial year’s losses by sections of the social and mainstream media also does not seem to take into account, that at least two other leading African airlines, Egypt Air and South African Airways, equally made large losses, with Egypt Air deeper in the red than Kenya Airways and South African only slightly better off. 
What has become clear though is that senior management in Embakasi, together with a team of consultants, are for weeks now burning the midnight oil to revise the various assumptions made when the airline’s strategic “Plan Mawingo” was formulated and unveiled a few years ago, and updating it by taking all parameter changes into account, different timelines included. 
“This is absolutely not the time to continue lashing out at our national airline,” said a Kenyan participant in the East Africa Tourism Platform meeting yesterday in Kigali. “KQ plays a major role to connect Kenya to key source markets. They are supportive of the tourism industry. Just the day before yesterday they signed a new MOU with the Kenya Tourist Board to join hands in cranking up destination marketing. This should help to get the ongoing recovery of our tourism sector into higher gear. Whatever issues there are, whatever issues the tourism industry has with our national airline, it is better to sit down with KQ and discuss the way forward through our associations instead of the social media. You will never see something like what is happening in Kenya happen here in Rwanda. From all I have seen, these guys stand solidly behind RwandAir and that is a lesson I take home with me.”",0.9451,0.05275723504890173,-0.35714285714285715

DUSIT International will be staking out a wider presence in Asia with its plans to expand to the Philippine island of Cebu by 2018. 

Representatives from Dusit International and Cebu-based developer Grand Land, Inc (GLI) signed an agreement to develop a Dusit Princess hotel in Cebu during a recent ceremony held at the City Sports Club in Cebu Business Park. 

The 295-key property, located north of Metro Cebu in the North Reclamation area, will be part of a mixed-use development containing retails outlets, offices and apartments. Facilities within the hotel include restaurants, meeting rooms, a gym and swimming pools. 

Ryan Bernard Go, president of GLI, expressed confidence that the construction of the project will begin this year. 

Go also revealed in a press statement that the firm is venturing into the hotel-apartment business because it sees the need for Cebu tourism to have more branded hotels. 

“We want to expand the tourism industry so we hope to develop hotels and resorts, north or south of Cebu. The partnership with Dusit International may extend to more GLI hotel projects.

74,"Visit Seattle Takes New Approach to Destination Marketing and Launches TV Series, Creates Branded Video Content and Traveler TestimonialsTravelandtourworld.com","Visit Seattle Takes New Approach to Destination Marketing and Launches TV Series, Creates Branded Video Content and Traveler Testimonials
Visit Seattle announced today a new marketing campaign converging traditional ads and marketing with content focused video. The new campaign features a Seattle TV series, focusing on music that will air on a national music channel, as well as inauguration of a new, web-based Visit Seattle TV channel with a series of video chronicles of individual first-time travelers to Seattle.
The decision to create a purely content based campaign dovetails with the increased importance of video for travelers and the new way they’re consuming content. It represents the first time a destination marketing organization (DMO) has taken this approach to marketing.
The components of Visit Seattle’s new campaign include the “Sounds by the Sound,” the first-of-its-kind, long-form series built entirely for a brand partner on Revolt TV (owned by Sean “P Diddy” Combs), “First Takes,” a video series showcasing actual Seattle visitors describing their first visits to the Emerald City, and a new branded web-based TV channel on the Visit Seattle web site called VISITSEATTLE.TV.
Visit Seattle teamed up with Publicis Seattle to create the two new branded series. “Sounds by the Sound” will premiere on Revolt TV online at VISITSEATTLE.TV the week of September 21. The series will explore Seattle’s music scene and celebrate the uniquely textured civic experience that informs and inspires it. The series will feature a mix of interviews with emerging and established artists and performances at city landmarks such as Chihuly Garden & Glass, Kubota Gardens, the Space Needle and CenturyLink Field. For example, the episode filmed inside CenturyLink Field, examines how music influences sports and includes interviews the Seattle Seahawks’ own DJ (the only official team DJ in the NFL) as well as the up-and-coming band The Flavr Blue, whose front woman is also featured on the hook of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ single “White Walls” and served as the lead producer on their viral videos for “Thrift Shop” and “Wing$.”
“During the past 20 years, Seattle has become known as an incubator for new music across all genres, so we decided to tap into Seattle’s rich music talent as one focus of our new campaign,” said Tom Norwalk, Visit Seattle President & CEO.
The second new video series, “First Takes,” will chronicle the sensory experiences of first-time Seattle visitors. The series is directed by documentary filmmaker Austin Wilson and will be featured on VISITSEATTLE.TV as well as through social media and various online destinations. The series features a wide range of traveler experiences ranging from first-time oyster tasting to smelling fresh roasted coffee to taking off in a seaplane over the Puget Sound. “We’re excited about this series because of the authenticity of the messaging when it comes from the mouths of the visitors,” said Ali Daniels, Visit Seattle V.P. of Marketing. “We are spoiled by what we have in our backyard, and it is eye opening to see it through a first-time visitor’s eyes. To hear someone describe paddle boarding in Portage Bay or watching the sun rise over Gas Works Park makes you fall in love with your city all over again.”

75,"Revealed: the inner world of Picasso, Dalí and beyond","Comments 
A new exhibition in London showcasing intimate images of the seminal artist, Pablo Picasso, among others, at work is curated by the Spanish painter's grandson. 
Revealed , launched in collaboration with the luxury hotel group Sofitel, captures artists, including Picasso, Salvador Dalí, Henry Matisse and Jean Cocteau, around the intimate setting of their work studios and homes. 
Following exhibits at the Sofitel hotels in New York, Los Angeles and Paris, the 30 photographs chosen by Picasso’s grandson Olivier Widmaier Picasso, the author of the book Picasso, Portrait intime , are now displayed at the Sofitel London St James. 
• Picasso: where to see his works around Europe 
Photo: Françoise Pages/Paris Match 
Selected from nearly 1,000 photographs from the exclusive archives of the Paris Match magazine, Mr Picasso hoped to portray ""how different artists can be in front of photographers, from shy to extremely comfortable,” he told Telegraph Travel. 
The unconventional exhibition setting of a hotel, which he considers to be “essentially a home away from home”, was aimed to simulate the “intimacy of an artist’s studio” he said. 
• Inside Paris's reopened Picasso Museum 
Scenes from the life of Picasso across six photographs form the highlight of the exhibition. As “one of the first artists of his time to accept that success and the spotlight are part of an artist's life”, Picasso had “a natural talent and instinct for posing in a picture and knew what would make a good photograph,"" his grandson told Telegraph Travel.

“The images I have chosen of my grandfather show not only how comfortable he was with photographers but also how aware and concerned he was about his own public image. 
“It's a bit bizarre that he allowed himself to be photographed, as he didn’t really like doing interviews on television and radio because he didn't like the sound of his voice. 
• Picasso sells for $179 million world record 
“And he never liked to explain his artwork”, preferring to leave it for others to interpret, said Mr Picasso. 
“My grandfather was completely accessible only up until the moment he says 'Okay, it's time to work', when he closes the door and needs to be alone. Once he was in his studio, he was alone and no one could really enter that space,” Mr Picasso told Telegraph Travel. 
Dutch painter Kees Van Dongen and Brigitte Bardot Photo: Izis/Paris Match 
Though Picasso, his grandson believes, “wasn’t the incredibly difficult man that everyone assumed he was”, he was stereotypical in that he lived in a world of organised chaos, as one picture of him in his Cannes villa might suggest. Sitting with his dalmatian and his future final wife, surrounded by all manner of seemingly randomly placed objects, from newspapers and artwork to clothing and instruments, ""the disorder of the living room/studio was illusory. Nothing was there by chance. They were all a part of Picasso's world of inspiration, infiltrating every aspect of his daily life"". 
One of the most candid pictures of Picasso, according to his grandson, is the one of him eating a cooked fish down to its bones, which he later used to create a clay sculpture that day, depicting his resourceful approach to creating art. 
• Painters' palettes in photographs - from Picasso to Van Gogh 
Other striking images from the collection include that of Salvador Dali standing next to a woman with a 'Lady Gaga-like' look sitting in an L-shaped glass box, as well as a recreation of Eugene Delacroix’s 'Liberty Guiding the People' painting by Liu Bolin, the Chinese artist known for blending himself into the background of different scenes in his pieces. Some of the more contemporary artists featured include David Hockney sitting back in a Tudor-style chair and Jeff Koons surrounded by various assistants, a favourite of Mr Picasso for its honest portrayal of how individual artists are in fact supported by a team of people to complete a piece.

The exhibiton continues in London until October 30 and will also be exhibited at the Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam and Sofitel Munich Bayerpost later this year. 
“I have rediscovered these incredible documents which capture the intimacy of my grandfather and the other major artists featured in the exhibition.

“The way it puts different artists into perspective reveals the diversity of the creative process and the personality of each artists work. It is equally fascinating to discover who has the power ‒ the photographer, or the one being photographed” Mr Picasso said.

JERUSALEM (NEWS 1130) – The new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in Jerusalem for talks with senior Israeli leaders, as violence spikes around the country.
This is US Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford’s first overseas trip since taking the job Oct. 1. He will meet with Lt. Gen. Gadi Eizenkot, the commander-in-chief of the Israel Defence Forces and others.
Navy Capt. Greg Hicks says the latest violence may come up in meetings, but Dunford’s visit was long-planned and his goal is to meet his Israeli counterparts and reaffirm America’s commitment to Israel. He also will visit other countries in the region.
The violence has been fueled in part by Palestinian fears that Israel is trying to expand its presence at a major Muslim-run shrine in Jerusalem. Israel denies that claim.

Majed Abdulaziz al-Saud, 28, had been scheduled to appear before a Los Angeles judge this week in relation to his September 23 arrest at a gated compound in Beverly Hills.
He spent a night in jail at the time and was released after posting a $300,000 (269,000 euros) bail.
Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district attorney's office, said authorities had decided not to pursue the charge of forced oral copulation against the prince because of lack of evidence.
""There was insufficient evidence to file charges,"" Robison told AFP. ""That's why we refered the case to the city attorney's office so that they can review and decide whether to file misdemeanor charges.""
Frank Mateljan, of the Los Angeles city attorney's office, said the case was under review and it was unclear whether the prince would face any charges at all.
Police were called to the palatial mansion in Beverly Hills after a bleeding woman was heard screaming for help as she tried to scale the wall of the property.
She told police that the prince had sexually assaulted her. Four other people also claimed they were victimized by the prince but not all alleged sexual assault.
The prince left the mansion following the incident and it was unclear whether he was still in the United States.

In compliance with the direction...I am here to surrender,"" Bharti said, adding, ""I was not running away from law. I was only availing the legal remedies guaranteed by the Constitution of India."" Bharti had a tough time to get out of his car and no police personnel offered any assistance. ""This too shall pass and truth shall prevail,"" Bharti tweeted from an undisclosed location around an hour before he gave up. A lawyer from Bharti said the legislator's father was unwell and that is why he could not surrender by evening as directed by the apex court. Bharti was ""avoiding"" and not ""evading"" police, he added. Soon after Bharti failed to get relief from the Supreme Court, AAP cornered its Malviya Nagar MLA asking him to surrender ""immediately"" to avoid ""further embarassment"" to the party and himself. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had also called his party colleague as an ""embarassment"". Bharti failed to get relief from the Supreme Court as it rejected his plea that he be given time tilltomorrow to surrender. ""We want him to surrender before appropriate jurisdiction of the police by this evening. We don't intend to pass any further order,"" a bench comprising Chief Justice H L Dattu and Justice Amitava Roy said while posting the matter for hearing on Thursday. The bench also rejected a further request by his counsel that he be given time till 7 pm to surrender. ""No, we will not give time. If you want your matter to come on Thursday, you have to surrender today itself,"" the bench said. Bharti's counsel and senior advocate Gopal Subramaniam submitted that the whole incident was an outcome of the matrimonial dispute in which, not only the couple, but their two children were also sufferers. The court should keep this in mind while hearing Bharti's appeal against the rejection of his anticipatory bail by the trial court and the Delhi High Court, he contended. However, the bench said it was not concerned with the issue at this stage and asked how should Bharti have conducted himself as a responsible citizen after dismissal of his plea for anticipatory bail by the trial court and the Delhi High Court. ""Not to say you have lost before two courts (trial court and High Court). You went for anticipatory bail before the trial court, you did not succeed. You went for anticipatory bail before the High Court, you did not succeed. What is your duty as a responsible citizen,"" the bench asked. ""First you surrender, then we will see whether the matter should be referred to mediation centre. We want family dispute to be sorted out but we can't be saying that we will be protecting an absconder.

81,Exiled Nigerian lecturer appeals for gay dialogue,"Updated: 5:02 a.m. Friday, Oct. 23, 2015 | Posted: 5:02 a.m. Friday, Oct. 23, 2015 Exiled Nigerian lecturer appeals for gay dialogue By MICHELLE FAUL   LAGOS, Nigeria — 
Bisi Alimi has been assaulted and persecuted and fled into exile, all because he is gay. Now, he's speaking out about his travails to persuade British legislators to engage Nigerian policy makers about a law that makes even befriending a homosexual a crime punishable by 10 years in jail. 
Just discussing Nigeria's Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act, passed in January 2014, could potentially land you in jail if it's seen as promoting homosexuality. 
""There is no law in the modern world like this law, not even in the Arab world,"" the 40-year-old actor and university lecturer told  , pointing to a clause making it a crime not to report a ""perceived"" homosexual. ""How do we find out whether this perceived homosexual is indeed homosexual or just a victim of hatred?"" he asked. 
The good news, he said, is that a growing minority of young Nigerians — 23 percent — are willing to accept homosexuality in a family member, according to a survey commissioned by his new Bisi Alimi Foundation. It also shows declining support for the law, from 96 percent in 2010 to 87 percent today. The telephone survey of 1,000 adults in all parts of the country carried out in April and May has a 3 percent margin of error. 
That still leaves a vast and hostile majority among Nigeria's 170 million deeply religious people. 
Alimi's foundation aims to stir up debate about the law's impact — on neighborliness, the economy and a brain drain that has scores of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Nigerians following his footsteps into exile. 
On Thursday, Alimi addressed a panel at the British Parliament in London, which includes at least five legislators born in Nigeria or of Nigerian parentage, appealing for Nigeria's former colonizer to use its influence. 
""It's not about them dictating to Nigeria but letting them (Nigerian policy makers) understand why it's important economically, politically and socially to not have such laws,"" he said. 
He noted a successful campaign in Uganda, where a court this year threw out an anti-gay law as unconstitutional. 
Nigeria has yet to prosecute anyone under its law, which has penalties of up to 14 years' imprisonment, but its passage has further endangered gays already subjected to violent public attacks that go unpunished, vandalization of property and arbitrary arrest and blackmail by corrupt police. There have been several prosecutions under a separate sodomy law, with an ongoing case involving a group of young men arrested for holding an all-male party where there were condoms in Lagos, the commercial hub. 
Alimi was the first Nigerian to come out on national TV 11 years ago, amid rumors about his sexuality and a national newspaper's attempt to blackmail him. He was attacked, verbally and physically, his landlord threw him out of his home, his character in a TV soap was killed, he lost his job, and the TV presenter who interviewed him lost hers. 
""It was the beginning of the end for me,"" he said. When he narrowly escaped being killed by young men who broke into his house, stripped him naked, whipped him and did things that still bring on nightmares to recall, he fled to Britain in 2007. 
Now a lecturer at Humboldt University of Berlin in sexual and racial gender identity and behavior in Africa, he seeks out any kind of discussion to get Nigerians thinking about his cause. 
So he was not bothered when Punch newspaper identified him as Nigeria's most hated person. ""I have no anger against it,"" he said. ""Even if your publicity is bad, the fact that people are talking is a good thing."" Copyright  ",-0.9954,0.06417748917748918,-0.28
82,Kenya launches operation against extremists on Somali border,"Updated: 10:32 a.m. Friday, Sept. 11, 2015 | Posted: 10:32 a.m. Friday, Sept. 11, 2015 Kenya launches operation against extremists on Somali border By RODNEY MUHUMUZA   KAMPALA, Uganda — 
Kenya on Friday announced a new security operation aimed at ousting Islamic extremists from a forest along the border with Somalia. 
Al-Shabab extremists have been using Kenya's vast Boni forest as cover to launch attacks on Kenyan territory, Interior Secretary Joseph Nkaisserry said. 
Al-Shabab, which has ties to al-Qaida, is increasingly encroaching on the Boni enclave amid pressure from African Union forces operating against the militants in their home base of Somalia. 
""This situation is compounded by the forested and bushy environment, which gives terrorists cover against both mobile and aerial surveillance,"" Nkaisserry said during the launch of the operation in the Kenyan coastal town of Lamu. 
The new military operation will be accompanied by a plan to improve infrastructure and social services for residents in the area, he said. 
Kenya has been attacked many times by al-Shabab, which opposes the country's decision in 2011 to send troops to fight the Islamic extremist group as part of the African Union force backing Somali's weak federal government. 
In September 2013, at least 67 people were killed in an attack by al-Shabab on the Westgate mall in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. 
In April, the group claimed responsibility for an attack on a college campus in northeastern Kenya that left at least 148 people dead. Copyright  ",-0.9805,-0.09792929292929294,-0.3333333333333333

BEIJING (AP) — China has handed over the remains of what are believed to be three American fliers killed in a plane crash in Tibet during World War II.
The ceremony in the city of Chengdu is a reminder of the strong cooperation between the U.S. and China's then-Nationalist Party government in the struggle against Japan.
The 28 human bones were found in and around the wreck of a C-87 transport plane that crashed in 1943 while flying over the Himalayas between China and India. They are believed to be from members of the U.S. military.
In more recent years, Beijing's current communist government and Washington have been viewed as locked in a struggle for military supremacy in Asia.

85,A Gossip Girl Gets the Graphic Novel Treatment,"0 COMMENTS It’s a quiet week in the city before the social season gets rocking and rolling, but as the cartoonist Marisa Acocella Marchetto knows, that means it’s also a potentially good time to generate some gossip.
That’s why her friends—some of whom who write the gossip pages and some of whom who regularly appear in them—threw her a book party Tuesday at her husband’s restaurant Da Silvano to celebrate the publication day of her new graphic novel, “Ann Tenna.”
In it, Ann Tenna, who’s a bit Brenda Starr, a bit Nancy Sinatra and a bit Emma Peel, happens to be a gossip columnist. She is the uber-successful founder of the site Eyemauler. But when a collision with a garbage truck throws her in the hospital, she re-connects with her cosmic double which puts into question everything she knows about her life in the universe.
“Her actual arc is based on my life,” said Ms. Marchetto. “After having cancer, I thought about where am I going and karma and energy. I wanted my imprint on the planet to be a good one.”
This being a book about fashion and Manhattan, however, there are cameos by Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel, Page Six editor Emily Smith, the once-hot but long-gone nightclub Moomba, and even an appearance from this particular column.
ENLARGE Cicely and Sandra Bernhard Photo: Liam McMullan/PatrickMcMullan.co ENLARGE Sarah Arnell, Lucy Sykes and Wednesday Martin Photo: Liam McMullan/PatrickMcMullan.co “I love reading gossip,” said Ms. Marchetto. “I love hearing what people are doing. To me it’s the story of humanity. It’s like the pulse of the planet. People are so fascinating and so interesting, and you want to know what’s going on.”
Then again, she added, “sometimes you want to live in a mud hut with no Wi-Fi.”
Ms. Marchetto had the idea for the character of Ann Tenna about 20 years ago. Originally, she was a “tween-age” gossip columnist who lived in suburban New Jersey, “but she always had antenna hair that connected to the universe. I called her the human radio.” Nine or so years ago, after Ms. Marchetto published her graphic memoir “Cancer Vixen” about her experience with the disease, Ann Tenna morphed into an adult living in the gossip-centric universe of New York City.
“There are so many elements that go into a graphic novel, which is kind of good, because I’m a control freak,” she said. “Not only was I the writer and the illustrator, but I was the director, the casting director, the costume designer.”
At one point, she realized two characters had similar hair braids “and I wanted to fire the script girl who was in charge of continuity. Of course, I was the script girl.”
ENLARGE Model Anastasia Karter and designer LaQuan Smith Photo: Getty Images Among the guests who joined Ms. Marchetto on Tuesday were New Yorker editor David Remnick, Lucy Sykes and Euan Rellie, adman Richard Kirshenbaum, Dayle Haddon, Marla Maples, Alina Cho, Sandra Bernhard, Robert Verdi, Wednesday Martin, Erica Jong and Molly Jong-Fast and the fashion designer LaQuan Smith. Mr. Smith not only designed Ms. Marchetto’s blue dress for the evening, but he also helped make a wrap dress based on her book’s cover art, worn Tuesday by the redheaded model Anastasia Karter.
“I did think about wearing it myself,” said Ms. Marchetto, “but I tried it on and said, ‘Ugh, I don’t think so.’ You need someone long and lean.”
Ms. Marchetto plans to bring Ms. Karter and the outfit to other signings and readings she has planned over the next few weeks.
Also for the party, Ms. Marchetto’s mother, a one-time shoe designer, made lots of “Ann Tenna”-inspired treats. And with the help of Espionage Cosmetics, Ms. Marchetto made 500 “Ann Tenna”-inspired nail wraps. She had three manicurists on hand to apply them onto the nails of her guests.
“That was definitely the first time there were manicurists at Da Silvano,” she said.

Croatian police say more than 90,000 migrants have passed through the country and moved on toward Western Europe in little more than two weeks.
Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said Thursday that only five people remain in one of the two main refugee camps in Croatia, while the rest have already moved on to Hungary.
Migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia want to reach the rich countries of Western Europe such as Germany and Sweden.
Croatia became a transit country for migrants in mid-September after Hungary closed its border with Serbia to stop the flow coming that way.

Human Rights Watch's report released Wednesday said children work in unstable 25-meter (80-foot) deep pits or underwater along coastal shores or rivers, processing gold with mercury, a toxic metal. Those who dive for gold stay underwater for hours in 10-meter- (30-foot-) deep shafts, receiving air from a tube attached to an air compressor.
The New York-based group says it interviewed 135 people, including 65 child miners from 9 to 17 years of age, in eastern Camarines Norte and Masbate provinces in 2014 and 2015.

Anthony Albanese on campaign trail Canning candidate Matt Keogh stands alongside Anthony Albanese as he speaks on Monday's leadership change, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop believes the change will unite the party room
PT1M9S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Albanese hits Canning campaign trail Canning poll wide open after Turnbull takes over Labor candidate Matt Keogh has wasted no time getting stuck into new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, saying he has abandoned the people of Canning by calling a leadership spill days before the weekend byelection.
Mr Turnbull became Australia's 29th Prime Minister on Monday night after a dramatic ballot saw him elected on a majority of 54 votes to Tony Abbott's 44.

Rumours has been flying around the corridors of Canberra for months, Mr Abbott leadership would be challenged if the Liberal party had a poor showing at the September 19 by-election, but Mr Turnbull didn't wait, pulling the trigger five days earlier.
Advertisement Mr Keogh said the new PM was clearly not interested in the Canning byelection.
""What we have really seen is the instability and dysfunction of the government,"" he said.
""What we have seen is this is all about Malcolm Turnbull… the government has abandoned the people of Canning. The actions taken by Malcolm Turnbull are not about Australia and they are not about the people of Canning.
""He made some comments last night he saw his actions more important than a byelection here, so I think that highlights how he really sees himself as more important than the issues on the ground for the people of Canning.""
""He made the move because he is concerned about Malcolm Turnbull and that is really the wrong priority.""
The 33-year-old wouldn't be drawn into speculation by political experts that the instability within the Liberal party would damage Liberal candidate Andrew Hastie's chances this Saturday.
The Liberal party holds the seat with a 11.8 margin and polling prior to the election had Labor getting a eight to 10 per cent swing.
Notre Dame university political expert Martin Drum told Fairfax Media on Monday night the by-election was now wide open, but Mr Keogh continued to play a straight bat, when asked about his chances.
The former WA Law Society President did say the recent spill would be in the back of mind of Liberal voters when they go to the ballot this Saturday.
""I think it's something the people will have in their minds - I think it's quite clear people don't like unstable government,"" Mr Keogh said.
"" We've seen that and that is something that is going to be in the back of their minds on Saturday. They will be thinking what is going on in this government, they can't be trusted.
""We are going to continue to do what we have been doing throughout the campaign, talking to voters and making sure we are addressing their concerns.
""What I am really concerned about is what the people are concerned about in this byelection - we have four days to go in this byelection and I will continue to be out there talking to the voters about what concerns them.""
Mr Keogh scoffed at suggestions by Mr Hastie that religion should be off the table during the campaign .
Mr Hastie's father is a Presbyterian priest understood to have strong leanings towards creationism.
""I think the morals and values of a candidate - the religious views of the candidates are actually very important for people to understand,"" he said.
""From my point of view, while my religion is something that has a bearing on my values it doesn't dictate what I will do, but it's important for people to understand that. It makes up the person that is the candidate. standing before them.
""I think people want to know what the candidate stands for and makes them tick.""
As for his chances this Saturday?
""Clearly we are going to win,"" he smiled.
