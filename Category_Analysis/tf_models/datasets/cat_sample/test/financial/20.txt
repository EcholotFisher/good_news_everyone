India is following a similar trend and slowly making its mark as a premier ‘Land of Festivals’. In a nation as diverse as India, several cultures have, over the centuries, made India a land of everlasting festivals. Every small occasion, from welcoming the spring or rain and the harvesting of crops, to seeing the full moon, lends itself to joyous celebrations splashed with colours, music, folk dances and songs. Festivals in India will take you for a holy dip in one of its numerous rivers, or cover you with scented colour, swing you sky high, give you elephant or camel rides, and invite you to joyous day and night-long singing, dancing and feasting.
Realising the potential of festivals and learning from the achievements of world renowned festivals such as the Rio Carnival in Brazil, La Tomatina in Spain and St Patrick’s Day Festivities in Ireland, even state tourism ministries have, in recent times, shifted their focus to promoting and showcasing Indian festivals to the world, as well as upping their marketing initiatives for increased domestic footfall.
