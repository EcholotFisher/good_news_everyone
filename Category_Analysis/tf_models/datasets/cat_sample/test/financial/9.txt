Chinese investors banned from shorting equities may be selling copper instead, exacerbating the metal’s collapse to the lowest in six years.
They’re seeking to hedge exposure to Chinese shares after the government stepped in to stem a stock-market collapse that wiped out $4 trillion in value, according to brokers including Guotai & Junan Futures Co. and Haitong Futures Co. Copper is being sold as a proxy for China’s broader economy, said Ivan Szpakowski, a commodity strategist at Citigroup Inc.
The move will add pressure on copper prices that have collapsed amid a wider rout in commodities spurred by slowing Chinese growth and persistent surpluses. The Shanghai Composite Index has rebounded from a 32 percent slump after the government banned major shareholders from selling stakes, suspended initial public offerings and allowed more than 1,400 companies to halt trading.
“Shorting commodities has become a widespread strategy to hedge investment in the stock market,” Yang Na, a Shanghai-based analyst with Haitong Futures, said by phone. “Metal prices have been further hit as the fundamentals have been weak this year because of China’s slowdown.”
Prices of everything from oil to metals and crops have tumbled with the Bloomberg Commodity Index dropping to the lowest in 13 years this week. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecasts further declines in copper as demand in China, which consumes about 40 percent of the world’s supply, is poised for the slowest expansion in almost two decades.
Stocks Hedge Copper futures on the Shanghai Futures Exchange slid 2.9 percent to 38,050 yuan ($6,128) a metric ton on Friday, the lowest level for the most-active contract since May 2009. The metal has slumped 17 percent this year amid China’s slowest economic expansion. Prices in London and New York are also at the lowest in six years.
“Some investors tried to short commodities to hedge their holding in the stock market,” said Xu Yongqi, a senior analyst at Guotai in Shanghai. “Metals such as copper, nickel and iron ore are the favorite because of good liquidity and high correlation with macroeconomics.”
Copper trading volumes by the 20 biggest brokers on the Shanghai Futures Exchange have more than doubled from before the start of the stock market rout in June, exchange data show.
“It’s about the equity market, financial flows and it’s about sentiment rather, to be honest, than underlying demand for commodities,” said Citibank’s Szpakowski. “We see the fundamentals actually being fairly decent for copper. The problem has been its use as a proxy for the Chinese economy, and especially because of the difficulty in taking a short position on Chinese equities.”
China’s Ministry of Public Security said this month that it’s helping the securities regulator look into evidence of “malicious” short selling of stocks and indexes following the equity rout. Police found signs some firms manipulated the trading of stock-market futures, the official Xinhua News Agency reported July 12, without saying where it got the information.
