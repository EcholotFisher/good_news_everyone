Kenya: Subarus, Honda Civics and BMWs, the Masinga Project Race Kicks Off 
Mr Mabeo said he was aware that as workers they have done a lot and had indeed rendered their mandate to the best of their ability, despite the challenges they encountered. 
"We celebrate success and recognise great potential amongst ourselves as MTC family. The government has mandated us to deliver to Batswana quality services efficiently," he said. 
Mr Mabeo condemned corruption and poor performance and called on employees to change the perception that their ministry was leading in corrupt practices. 
The minister said he was aware that there were some officers who had the customer at heart and those who still need to work hard, in order to reach the expected customer levels, adding that such a demand was achievable as all our customers deserve excellent service. 
He cited as the ministry's achievements the provision of infrastructure such as roads, airports and telecommunications infrastructure, adding that paved roads have reached some of the remotest parts of the country, and that had ease free movement of goods and services. 
Mr Mabeo said his ministry also continues to facilitate the public sector by ensuring that roadworthy vehicles and reliable transport were provided to Batswana. 
"On the telecommunications sector, we have seen penetration of mobile phones and an increased use of communication technology," he added. 
Minister Mabeo also urged employees to embrace the public service commemoration theme, "Innovating public service delivery to implement the post 2016 development agenda," saying it was a key concept to them as a technical ministry. 
He commended those individuals who had done their best and came up with an expression, "we are all winners in principle." He also urged them to reflect on the 10 point agenda initiatives. 
In her welcome remarks, permanent secretary in the ministry, Ms Goitsemang Morekisi said there was a lot that the ministry had done hence the need to look back and celebrate amid challenges of financial constraints and lack of resources. 
Ms Morekisi urged the employees to have the spirit of togetherness, work in unison and with determination to achieve the ministry's mandate, mission and vision. 
She commended those who worked hard to make the ministry what it is today and urged them to instill the same spirit in others.
