Economic and corporate news expected from Monday, August 3 to Friday, August 7. 
MONDAY AUGUST 3 
Shareholders in HSBC will hope for an update on the bank’s plans to move its headquarters, as bosses will set out their first set of finances since the Chancellor changed the bank tax regime in his emergency Budget. 
London-based HSBC is considering moving its headquarters out of the UK and to a location such as Singapore or Hong Kong, in part because its global operations have been hit hard by the UK’s bank levy a 0.21pc charge on British banks’ UK balance sheets. HSBC protested after the levy was raised in March, and so in July the Chancellor promised to cut the levy’s rate over the coming years, and instead introduce an extra tax on profits made in the UK. 
The board plans to make a decision on domicile by the end of the year, but chief executive Stuart Gulliver will be expected to give a progress report this week.

Aircraft handling and maintenance group BBA Aviation (LSE: BBA.L - news ) reports interim results, and investors will be looking for more detail about how the falling price of oil is affecting the business. In May, an update for the AGM revealed that group revenue was in line with expectations, having declined 5pc mainly because of the falling price of fuel. However, excluding this factor, acquisitions, disposals and fluctuating currencies, it was 3pc higher, though the market seems to have taken a negative view with the shares testing a three-year low since the announcement.

FRIDAY AUGUST 7 
William Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) will reveal the extent to which the imposition of a UK point of consumption tax and the recent rise in machine-gaming duty have hit profits. In the past three years, changes in regulation in the UK have resulted in earnings downgrades of 28pc for the bookmaker. As negative rhetoric around the industry builds, Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) has recently downgraded the stock from “outperform” to “neutral”, pointing to concerns such as the introduction of a living wage and single staffing. Analysts expect half-year results to point to a 17pc fall in pre-tax profit to £123m. Karl Burns, of Panmure Gordon, reckons poor results in the first quarter will hurt profits.
