When consumers shop for a specific designer's labe l whether it be for clothes, fashion accessories , handbags, shoes.etc the purchaser is making a statement that reflects more than the latest trend or status. Targeting a certain designer gives both the consumer and designer a simpatico that their work looks good on them, for lack of a better word. 
Just as with shopping for many other items, the convenience of online shopping as opened the door to more brand awareness, more selection and lower prices, enabling consumers who were leery of spending top dollar for a prestigious label at a bricks and mortar store. The internet has also leveled the playing field, by facilitating new up and coming designers to promote their collections via the web . No longer is it a prerequisite to be on the runway of the latest fashion show in Milan, Paris or New York. Young designers who were waiting to be discovered no longer have to shell out big bucks to get in the game. 
Other innovations in technology have also advanced the fashion industry . While 3-D printing technology is still in its infancy, the cost is going down and accessibility increasing.Designers are already bypassing the manufacturer and "printing" their collections in house.This will be a win win for both the designer and consumer because it means higher profit margins for the designer and yet a lower price for the end consumer. 
The perception of designer labels being too pricey for the budget shopping consumer is no longer out of reach due to these advances in technology. Since everything 'Old is new again' mantra in the world of styles and trends, the way designers are exposing their collections is new and changing exponentially.
