Western Union, a leader in global payment services, has celebrated its 20 th anniversary in Africa at a colorful event in Accra. 
As part of activities marking the anniversary, Western Unionâ€™s President for Africa, Middle East, Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe and CIS, Jean Claude Farah, in addition to the Africa leadership team, visited the first agent location at Agricultural Development Bank (adb) that offered Western Union money transfer services for the first time in Africa in 1995. 
Senior management of both Western Union and adb highlighted the importance of their collaboration over the past 20 years, stating that it has provided fast, reliable and convenient options for money transfer. 
The Western Union leadership team also visited Ecobank head office in Accra and marked the occasion with the launch of the Account-Based Money Transfer (ABMT). 
This innovative transfer service allows you to receive your Western Union money transfer through your Ecobank account. 
You can visit any Ecobank (ATM) or use Ecobank Internet Banking to move money to your bank account. 
Western Union reiterated its commitment to expansion and development of its pan-African network which provides a critical link to the ever-growing African Diaspora. 
Jean Claude Farah, in a speech said, 'More than 30 million Africans live outside their home countries, contributing billions of US dollars in remittances to their families and communities back home. 
'We are very humbled to play a role in helping them move their money as they seek to elevate their economic status, contribute to the education of future generations and in many instances build their own small businesses.' 
With 34,000 locations in more than 50 countries and territories, the Western Union network serves more than 17 million senders and receivers in 120 currencies.
