Tue, Aug 18, 2015, 15:13 BST - UK Markets close in 1 hr 17 mins European stocks mixed after China plunge AFP â€“ 4 minutes 58 seconds ago View Photo 

European stock markets were mixed Tuesday after another plunge on China's main index, and on the eve of a German vote on Greece's new bailout. 
London's benchmark FTSE 100 index dipped 0.44 percent to stand at 6,521.71 points in mid-afternoon trade in the British capital. 
Frankfurt's DAX 30 edged up 0.04 percent to 10,944.66 points while the CAC 40 in Paris inched 0.01 percent higher to 4,984.40 compared with Monday's close. 
Investors were "keeping tabs on Asian markets," said Brenda Kelly, head analyst at traders London Capital Group. 
On Tuesday, the Shanghai index closed down 6.15 percent on broad worries over the slowing Chinese economy and the government's commitment to prop up shares, dealers said. 
"The Asian session's Chinese volatility continued to weigh on the commodities, with Brent Crude at $48.50 per barrel and copper hitting fresh six year lows; this meant the FTSE's oil and mining stocks returned to a uniform shade of red," said Connor Campbell, an analyst with Spreadex. 
Elsewhere in Asia, Thai stocks notched their steepest decline this year, and the baht slid to its lowest level versus the dollar since 2009 after a bomb attack Monday killed at least 20 people and injured scores in Bangkok. 
In Europe, official data showed that Britain's annual inflation rate rose to 0.1 percent in July. 
Sterling climbed strongly against both the euro and dollar on the inflation statistics, which fuelled expectations of a rate hike from the Bank of England in the first half of next year. 
Markets are scrutinising inflation data -- which has been kept low of late by falling energy and food prices -- for indications of when the Bank of England may start raising its key interest rate from the current record-low level of 0.50 percent. 
In reaction to Tuesday's figures, the British pound jumped to $1.5675 from $1.5586 on Monday. 
The euro fell to $1.1028 from $1.1078 late in New York on Monday. 
- Fed hike 'priced in' - 
The US Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is expected to start hiking its near-zero rate before the end of the year. 
"A Fed rate hike for either September or December is largely priced in now, so the dollar may struggle to gain further ground going forward, especially against some of the stronger currencies like the pound," said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at Forex.com. 
Market focus was also fixed on Greece, on the eve of a German parliamentary vote to approve the new bailout for Athens. 
As Europe's biggest economy and contributor to Greek aid, Germany plays a key role in the emergency package approved by eurozone finance ministers worth up to 86 billion euros ($96 billion). 
On Wall Street, US stocks opened lower Tuesday following disappointing earnings from Wal-Mart and in response to the turbulence in Chinese equity market. 
Five minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.18 percent to 17,512.95 points. 
The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.12 percent to 2,099.83 points, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.21 percent to 5,080.98.
