Swipe Right to Get Hired? Tinder-Like App for Job-Seekers Written by: Farran.Powell 08/20/15 - 8:28 AM EDT 
NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Jobs apps that use the same technology as online dating apps are quickly being adapted by 20- and 30-something candidates, shifting the search process from job boards to match apps on smart phones. 
Similar to romantic matchmaking, job search apps marshal data on candidates, and many of these apps display similar interface to the popular social matchmaking app Tinder — swiping left to reject and right to accept a potential career match. 
”The early adapters have been Millennials, younger people," said Rasheen Carbin, chief marketing officer at nspHire, a Chicago-based job search app that launched in October 2014. "They use Tinder, so they get the idea the idea of a match and in-app messaging." More Headlines The College Planning Mistake That's Putting Your Kids On the Road To Huge Debt 
Carbin, 38, founded the nspHire app with college friend Daniel Mullaney and have had about 12,000 candidates registered since the launch with 130 employers, which are mainly tech-based firms. 
The majority of its candidates on the nspHire app (the name is a play on "inspire") are aged between 22 and 26 and applying for telecommute tech-based jobs such as Java developers, said Carbin. 
”They tend to have bachelor's or associate's degrees and are not so far out from [finishing] college," Carbin said, who added many of nspHire's applicant apply for telecommute technology-based jobs. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that 44% of college graduates were underemployed in June 2014. 
“We see today that job boards are broken and black holes where job seekers apply and never hear back,” said Susan Zheng, co-founder of the New York City-based start-up Lynxsy. 1
