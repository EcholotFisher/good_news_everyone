In Navi Mumbai, too, a delegation from the Builders Association of Navi Mumbai took a demonstration march to the offices of Cidco and the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation. A builder delegation from MCHI-CREDAI called on Maharashtra chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and expressed concern over the administrative sanction process hitting the real estate sector.Housing minister Prakash Mehta was present at the meeting.
 
Fadnavis on Tuesday directed the state administration to evolve and implement an automated Development Control Regulation (DCR) permission system over the next two months. The system would not need human interventions and it would leave no scope for blackmailing of developers by politicians or officials.

The police have revised the accidental death report they had filed in the suicide case last Wednesday. Police claimed they have secured sizeable leads. Police have seized mobile phones, laptops and other gadgets used by Parmar.
 
Parmar, in his suicide note, has written that builders have no answers to customers' queries on completion of projects due to stays and notices issued to them by the civic body. He stated that local corporators, in nexus with civic officials, get notices sent to builders and in return, they have to pay at every turn. In the note, he has mentioned he was not under any kind of debt.
 
In Bengaluru, hundreds of personnel from the real estate industry took to the streets in protest. As part of an All-India protest against the “business environment” for real estate developers, CREDAI-Karnataka too closed their offices on Tuesday. The protestors marched to Vikasa Soudha, where a memorandum was submitted to Bengaluru district in-charge Minister Ramalinga Reddy. Among the demands presented in the memorandum was to improve “ease of business” for the developers and for faster approvals. With 30% of the sale price of flats going in taxes and cesses, realtors said they were put in a bind due to the inflating costs of constructions. Similarly, interference from various departments, officers and archaic by-laws was making development of land difficult, said the protestors.
 
In Pune also, there were extensive protests from the real estate industry.
