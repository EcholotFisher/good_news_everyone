Wed, Jul 22, 2015, 6:41 PM AEST - Australia Markets closed $A up following stronger CPI data AAP â€“ 1 hour 27 minutes ago Recommend Print 
The Australian dollar has gained ground, tracking higher on the back of a positive inflation print for the year to June. 
At 1700 AEST on Wednesday, the currency was trading at 74.17 US cents, up from 73.58 cents on Tuesday. 
ANZ senior FX strategist Dan Been said it has been a fairly thin market for most of the day. 
He said the slightly stronger year-on-year CPI numbers, which rose to 1.5 per cent, drove a short squeeze in the currency. 
"We did see it track a little higher," he said. 
But Mr Been said comments from Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens indicating there was more scope for interest rate easing caused a slight dip in the Aussie. 
"I would say in both directions the moves were more about positioning. We didn't learn anything fundamentally new today with the information we saw," he said. 
"There's also been a weight on the currency because iron ore futures in China are down almost four per cent." 
At 1700 AEST, the Australian dollar was at 91.75 Japanese yen, up from Tuesday's close of 91.53 yen, and at 67.70 euro cents, down from 67.94 euro cents. 
The bond market is stronger after the inflation figures missed expectations. 
The 1.5 per cent rise in the year to June was weaker than economists' expectations of a 1.7 per cent lift, and well below the RBA's two to three per cent target band. 
"We had a whippy session," RBC Capital Markets fixed income and currency strategist Michael Turner said. 
"We rallied a bit on the CPI data. We've backed off a bit from the highs but we're still closing in reasonably firm territory." 
Mr Turner said comments from Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens also had an impact. 
"He said rate cuts were still on the table - that headline was enough to restore a tiny bit of a bid," he said. 
At 1630 AEST on Wednesday, the September 2015 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 97.065 (implying a yield of 2.935 per cent), up from 97.020 (2.980 per cent) on Tuesday. 
The September 2015 three-year bond futures contract was at 98.000 (2.000 per cent), up from 97.970 (2.030 per cent). @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook
