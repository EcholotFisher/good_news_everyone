Are You Sure You Know the Difference Between a Roth 401(k) and a Traditional 401(k)? 08/03/2015 - 4:29 PM EDT 
NEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — If someone offered you the choice of $100,000 in a regular 401(k) or $100,000 in a Roth 401(k) , which should you take? If you think it doesn’t matter, go to the back of the class. But don’t feel too bad. Most of the class will be back there with you. 
The correct answer is that you should choose the Roth 401(k). That’s because taxes have already been paid on those funds, so you can withdraw them tax-free in retirement. Regular 401(k) contributions, of course, are made pre-tax. You don’t owe taxes now on money put into a regular 401(k), but you must pay taxes later when principal and gains are withdrawn. 
“The balance may look the same when you see your statement, but in fact the Roth 401(k) balance represents greater savings in terms of what you can buy,” said John Beshears, a Harvard Business School researcher who recently co-authored a study examining how well people understand Roth 401(k) plans .
