Northern Illinois Big 12 The Maple Leafs finished second overall (339) and were first among Northern Illinois Big 12 West teams. DeKalb’s Austin Freeman won the individual crown with a three-over par 75, and DeKalb, from the East, earned the overall team title (323). Geneseo’s Austin Jump was the NIB 12 West conference champion on Sept. 30. He tied for third individually firing a 38 on the back nine for an 80 at Senica’s Oak Ridge course in LaSalle. The Maple Leafs’ Nathan Lauritzen carded a 84 to finish in a tie for 10th, and Ryan Ford finished with an 86 for a tie for 13th. Wyatt Wade came to the clubhouse with an 89 on the scorecard for Geneseo, and Jordan Anderson finished his round with a 91. Geneseo’s Marshall Rice rounded out the varsity scores with a 101. Jump and Ford were named to the all-conference team, and Lauritzen just missed having enough points to earn a all-conference spot. In the frosh/soph conference tournament, Geneseo finished eighth (423) in the 10-team field. DeKalb won the team title, and Yorkville’s Andrew Madej was the individual champion shooting a 86. Patrick Turpin turned in a 103 finishing tied for 25th individually to lead the way for Geneseo. Devin VanRycke and Ty Johnson were a stroke back at 104, and Shane Lievens finished with a 112. The Leafs’ Jack Roberts carded a 117, and Ian Phillips finished with a 125. Sterling Regional The Maple Leafs claimed their first boys’ golf regional championship since 1991, and Ford was the individual winner for Geneseo with a 79. The Leafs combined for a 349 team score outdistancing runner up Sterling (352) by three strokes for the title among the 10-team field. Ford was the only player in the field to score in the 70’s at Emerald Hill Golf Course on Oct. 6. With the courses green’s playing fast, Ford said his approach shots and making tester putts, from the 5-to-10 foot range, was a big key to keeping his round going. “Going in we knew we had a really good shot to do some damage,” Ford said. “Last year, we felt the same way that we could come in and win. Maybe we went in with the wrong attitude, but this season was more about just getting the job done.” Every stroke, from every player had an impact on the outcome as Geneseo grinded their way to the title. Geneseo’s Jump fired a 87 finishing individually in eighth place, and Anderson finished in a tied for 11th after carding a 91. Page 2 of 2 - Wade and Rice each scored a 92 to finish tied for 14th, and Lauritzen landed 30th with a 97. The last time Geneseo won a regional boys’ golf crown was seven years before Ford was born. “For the seniors to leave with three conference championship in a row and add a regional title, it’s special,” Ford said. “We feel like we left a mark on the program.” The Maple Leafs advance as a team to the 2A Freeport Sectional at Park Hills Golf Course on Monday, Oct. 12. The Maple Leafs have some experience on the course having played the regional tournament there last season. Ford said hitting greens and finding a way to two-putt will be the key to keeping the round together. A senior, Ford was on the cusp of reaching state during his junior season but was eliminated in a playoff for the final spot at sectionals. It was a tough way to end the season, and Ford said he’s been thinking about sectionals all year, and it might have come at the right time. Ford said he’s focused and playing with confidence going into the tournament. “I’ve been playing varsity since I was a freshman,” Ford said. “I’ve left a bad taste in my mouth every year. This summer, my goal has been to just not have a bad taste in my mouth when this season ends.” By Chris Steele
