 CHICAGO — As the Mets clinched their first pennant since 2000 on Wednesday, their 8-3 victory over the Cubs came with sobering news. Yoenis Cespedes, their star slugger, left the game in the second inning with a sore left shoulder. The severity of the injury and how it occurred were not immediately clear, Manager Terry Collins said during an in-game interview on TBS.
Speculation swirled after the injury because Cespedes had been spotted playing golf at a Chicago-area course earlier in the day, according to a report from a local NBC affiliate. An avid golfer, Cespedes often seeks out courses to play when he is on road trips.
If Cespedes is out for any period of time, the Mets will miss him. During the regular season, he was a dark-horse candidate for the Most Valuable Player Award. In the division and championship series, he batted .265 and had a double, two home runs and seven R.B.I. in nine games.

And right now, on this stage, he’s starting to show it off.”
Cespedes will have five days off before the World Series begins on Tuesday.
