It hasn’t been easy, but we kept trying because we can’t wait to bring our first child into the world and grow our family.”

“We’re so excited that it’s finally happening,” Teigen continued. “Thank you for all your love and well wishes. I look forward to all the belly touching! Xx.” 
The model has been candid about the coupleâs fertility struggles recently, opening up about the media pressure on her FABLife talk show in September. 
“Every single time I sit down for an interview with anybody….I will say, just being two years into being married, the questions just come from all over,” Teigen said. “Itâs kind of crazy because I canât imagine being that nosy to be like, âSo, when are the kids coming?â because who knows what somebodyâs going through.”

The Lip Sync Battle co-host revealed that she and Legend have been trying to conceive over the last few years, and have seen fertility doctors. 
“John and I were having trouble. We would have had kids five, six years ago if it had happened,” Teigen said. “But my gosh, itâs been a process.” 
While the model is no stranger to TMI moments, she told ET that Legend was “fine” with her sharing the coupleâs struggle to conceive. 
“It would’ve been odd for me not to talk about it on the show because it’s been such a huge part of our life,” she said. “I’ve been doing this for years. It’s been weird to hide it from people, but I didn’t want to just tweet, 'Doin’ my shots again!’” 
Teigen married the 36-year-old singer in September 2013.
