Florida receiver Brandon Powell has been a dynamic option for Will Grier and the offense. 
The 5'9" sophomore out of Deerfield Beach, Fla., is second on the team in receptions (13) and receiving yards (239). Powell also leads the team with an 18.4 yards-per-reception average (for players with at least five catches on the year) and touchdown grabs (3). You guys had TONS of questions for WR @_Powellbp4 . See what he had to say in this week's #AskAGator . https://t.co/3SRpb9uZU5 â€” Gators Football (@GatorsFB) October 8, 2015 
His ability to evade defenders in space is special, as is Powell's sublime speed and quickness from all parts of the field. 
Powell recently fielded questions from fans on Twitter (courtesy of the official Florida Twitter page). He was very candid with his answers, and what he calls his most important play of the season may surprise you. MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you? Sign up for our College Football newsletters. 0
