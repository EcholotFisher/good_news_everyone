Bastrop County residents will soon be able to drive both ways across flood-damaged Shiloh Road, following a recent heated meeting between residents and county officials.
For the past four months, those living in and traveling through the Shiloh community, west of Bastrop and south of Texas 71, have been unable to drive across the Shiloh Road bridge near Texas 304 after record-breaking rainfall during the Memorial Day floods left a deep crater in the roadway. Officials now say a temporary two-lane dirt road will allow cars to pass through again as soon as by the end of next week.
Shiloh Road was one of three bridges throughout the county that were washed out during the storm. County officials have been working with Federal Emergency Management Agency workers to put in place repair plans since the county was approved for federal public assistance. In total, officials have identified 700 sites on county roadways that need fixes and estimate the total costs of flood-related damages to be upwards of $5 million.
Bastrop County Judge Paul Pape speaks to about 30 residents gathered in the Shiloh Community Center Sept. 29 about the plans to place a temporary fix over the gaping hole in Shiloh Road to allow a single lane for cars. JILLIAN BECK/BASTROP ADVERTISER At least 30 residents packed into the Shiloh Community Center on Sept. 29 to get some answers from Bastrop County Judge Paul Pape, Pct. 1 Commissioner Willie Piña and Emergency Management coordinator Mike Fisher.
Pape, Piña and Fisher laid out a plan to set up a temporary fix: a single-lane passage over the damaged bridge now, and a more permanently repaired bridge to mitigate future flooding about seven months later. The officials attempted to explain the intricacies of seeking approval from FEMA to get reimbursed, but residents in attendance expressed frustration at the focus on the bureaucratic process.
The meeting devolved into shouting at times, with community members voicing concerns that forcing cars to take turns crossing on a one-lane temporary road would be too dangerous because drivers often speed down the roadway; county officials, however, insisted it would be the only way to create a way to pass soon.
“I know that a lot of us have been communicating to you — we were asking for you all to communicate with us about the repairs, not give us a temporary fix that we do not want,” Bernie Jackson said during the meeting. Jackson is the pastor of Trinity Zion Ministries, which is located just down the road from the damaged bridge.
At one point, former County Commissioner Johnny Sanders walked up to Piña at the front of the room and challenged him to utilize reserves from his road and bridge budget to pay for a two-lane temporary repair for Shiloh Road.
“Sometimes it doesn’t matter if you can get reimbursed or not, some times it matters if you’re doing the right thing,” Sanders said to Piña.
But much of the back-and-forth during the meeting proved to be moot because when Pape, Fisher and Piña touched base with the county engineer a day after the public meeting, they learned a two-lane fix would, in fact, be possible. Piña said he hopes the two-lane temporary repairs will be in place by the first full week of October.
Piña added Wednesday that as commissioner, he needs to be cautious in how he spends taxpayer dollars. If he were to turn away a possible opportunity for federal reimbursement on a project only to spend more of his road and bridge budget, he would have to explain that decision to his constituents living in other parts of the precinct that also need road repairs.
FEMA has estimated the total cost of the more permanent repairs to the road, which will include putting in more drainage pipes to prevent the road from washing away again, at about $150,000, Fisher said. But the cost will not be determined until the project goes out for bids early next year.
Before the Sept. 29 meeting, county officials had not receive the most up-to-date information from the engineers in preparation for the community meeting, which led to much of the confusion, Pape said.
“We need to have our facts straight before we try to tell a community what we can and cannot do,” Pape said in an interview Wednesday, reflecting on his takeaway from the meeting.
But, Pape added that he was glad the meeting eventually led to a solution that the community wanted, while still keeping the county’s option for getting funding from FEMA for a longer-term solution.
Still, Shiloh Community Association President Kenneth Limuel said in an interview Wednesday that he thinks there is a larger problem with communication between the county and his community. He said he plans to ask the county officials to come back and explain the new plan.
“I don’t have any regrets about how the meeting went because that’s what happens when you don’t communicate,” Limuel said. “No hard feelings, but at the same time, as a community of folks we want to be able to be listened to.”
