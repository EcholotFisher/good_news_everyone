Nine of 10 area volleyball teams will begin their quest toward the ultimate title this week -- the 10th, meanwhile, will begin its trek next week. 
Amongst those 10 are favorites, dark horses and longshots, but each will look forward to the challenge. 
Buford has spent most of the season as a favorite in Class AAAA, and, after finishing as state runner-up last season, the Lady Wolves will look to grasp the championship trophy this go around. The Area 8-AAAA champs will open their state playoffs on Wednesday against Mt. Zion, Jonesboro. 
Also, in Class AAAA, North Hall, the No. 3 seed from 8-AAAA, will travel to face Grady. The Lady Trojans reached the elite eight championship tournament in 2014. 
In Class , Gainesville enters the postseason flying high, as the Lady Red Elephants notched their first ever area title last week. Gainesville will look to continue its stellar play when it plays host to Alexander in the first round on Thursday. 
The Class AAA bracket is chock full of area squads, including six northeast Georgia-based programs. 
East Hall enters the postseason on the heels of its second straight Area 7-AAA crown, and the Lady Vikings would love to improve on last year’s elite eight appearance. East Hall will play host to Glenn Hills in the first round. Jefferson, the No. 2 seed from Area 8-AAA, and Fannin County, No. 2 from 7-AAA, will also host first round contests -- North Clayton traveling to Jefferson and Josey heading to Fannin County. 
Elsewhere, 7-AAA No. 3 seed West Hall will trek to Johnson, Augusta, while four seeds Lumpkin County (7-AAA) and East Jackson (8-AAA) will battle at Westside, Augusta and Jackson, respectively. All Class AAA matches are scheduled for Wednesday. 
Finally, in Class AA, Rabun County -- which received an at-large bid to the state tournament -- will travel to Pace Academy in the first round. The Class AA tournament, featuring just 16 teams, will begin play on Oct. 20.
