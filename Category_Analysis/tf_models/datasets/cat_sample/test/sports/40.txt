HONG KONG â€” Jelena Jankovic of Serbia came back from the brink of defeat on Sunday to outpower Angelique Kerber in the final of the Hong Kong Open, putting on hold the German's hopes of playing in the season-ending WTA Finals in Singapore. 
Fourth-seeded Jankovic, who beat Venus Williams in the quarterfinals, was a set and 6-5 down before rallying to beat second-seeded Kerber 3-6, 7-6 (4), 6-1 at Hong Kong's Victoria Park for her 15th WTA title. 
Ninth-ranked Kerber needed to win to confirm a berth at the WTA Finals. 
Former top-ranked Jankovic, who added to her Guangzhou title at the beginning of the Asian swing, relied on her powerful baseline game to out-slug Kerber who lost the second set in a one-sided tiebreaker. 
The 30-year-old Jankovic broke Kerber early in the decider and again in the sixth game before wrapping it up by serving out the match.
