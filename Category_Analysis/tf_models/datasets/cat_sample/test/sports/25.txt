Allen Park — Lions linebacker DeAndre Levy (hip) practiced for the second straight day Friday, which is a good sign for his availability in Monday night’s game against the Seattle Seahawks.
Defensive end Ziggy Ansah (groin) returned to practice after sitting Thursday, but will likely be listed as limited. Like Levy, Ansah participating is a good sign that he could be ready for the upcoming game.
Running back Joique Bell (ankle) and tight end Brandon Pettigrew (hamstring) were the only players who did not participate. However, Pettigrew did some running off to the side with a trainer for the first time during the portion open to the media since he suffered the injury in Week 1.
The Lions will release a practice report listing limited players later Friday afternoon. The game designations for Monday’s game will be available Saturday.
