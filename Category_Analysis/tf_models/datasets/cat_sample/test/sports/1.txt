MONTREAL â€” Marcel Aubut has resigned as president of the Canadian Olympic Committee while under investigation for a sexual harassment complaint. 
The committee said in a statement Saturday its investigation now ends. Since the original complaint, two other women made allegations against Aubut. 
The committee calls the matter "deeply concerning," saying it has had a "profound impact on our Olympic family." The committee adds that its board will begin the process of appointing an interim president in the coming days. 
Aubut already had temporarily stepped aside as committee president and chairman of the Canadian Olympic Foundation. The committee had retained a former chief justice of the Quebec Superior Court to investigate the initial complaint. 
The 67-year-old Aubut was CEO of the NHL's Quebec Nordiques until the team moved to Colorado in 1995. He was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1999.
