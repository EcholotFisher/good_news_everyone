ST. CHARLES – Blake Tierney’s goal with less than five minutes to play not only gave St. Charles North boys soccer the 1-0 victory over Geneva on Tuesday night, it also won the North Stars the Upstate Eight Conference River Division crown. 
After falling to Streamwood on Saturday, in its first attempt to clinch the River title, North (14-3-3, 5-21 UEC River) responded strong, on its senior night, to earn the first conference championship since 2006. 
“This was definitely one of our goals at the beginning of the season and the guys earned it,” North coach Eric Willson said. “It’s been a long time coming, but I’m just so proud of this group of guys. They have worked so hard from the offseason until now and it’s great to see that hard work pay off. They deserve this.” 
The North Stars’ next contest will be Tuesday as part of the Class 3A Bartlett Regional, as they take on the winner of a play-in game between Rolling Meadows and Glenbard East.
