After sitting out the past two and a half games with a hamstring injury, Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch is expected to return for the team's Week 6 matchup against the Panthers .
On Monday, a day after the Seahawks dropped their third game of the season by blowing a 17-point fourth quarter lead, coach Pete Carroll indicated that they should have their best offensive player back for their next game.
Pete Carroll expects Seahawks RB Marshawn Lynch (hamstring) to return for the Panthers game. "He should be back."
â€” Sheil Kapadia (@SheilKapadia) October 12, 2015 The last time we saw Lynch, he carried the ball five times in the Seahawks' Week 3 win over the Bears. But after exiting that game, Lynch didn't play against the Lions last Monday or Sunday against the Bengals.
In his place, rookie Thomas Rawls has thrived as the Seahawks' feature back. Against the Bears, he averaged 6.5 yards per carry and racked up 104 yards. Against the Lions, he was shut down along with the rest of the offense, but he responded by carrying the ball 23 times for 169 yards and a touchdown against the Bengals. And that means the Seahawks can afford to ease Lynch back into the fold, considering Rawls figures to snag a few carries as long as he continues to produce like he has been.
So far this season, Lynch is averaging just 3.4 yards per carry and has failed to reach the end zone. The Seahawks are also struggling to find their footing, winning just two of their first five games. Beast Mode will be back against the Panthers.
