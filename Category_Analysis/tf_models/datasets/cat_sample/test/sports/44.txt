Could March Madness become May Madness? By John Hickey Posted: 10/14/2015 07:27:55 PM PDT Updated: 10/14/2015 07:27:57 PM PDT NCAA basketball vice-president Dan Gavitt says the idea of pushing back the start of the college hoops season to mid-December to avoid the conflict with football is beginning to gain momentum. 
Gavitt, who recently talked to Jon Wilner of this newspaper, said there is a portion of the NCAA membership that thinks a later start is worthy of consideration. "There are merits on a lot of levels," Gavitt told Wilner. 
The problem with trading March Madness for madness in April or May will be the availability arenas that are hosting NBA or NHL playoffs. Whereas NBA or NHL teams are willing to share their arenas in March, which still is part of the regular season for both leagues, they aren't quite as cooperative once the playoffs begin. 
"We've had conversations as far as playoff windows,'' Gavitt said. "The (pro) teams can't, or are unwilling, to hold dates for us." Advertisement
