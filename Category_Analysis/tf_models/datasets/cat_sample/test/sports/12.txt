Former National Basketball Association star Lamar Odom was released from a Las Vegas hospital on Monday amid signs of improvement following his drug-fuelled binge in a Nevada brothel, a report said. 
E! Online entertainment news website said Odom, who was left fighting for his life after collapsing at the Love Ranch brothel last week, was being moved to a medical facility nearer his Los Angeles home. The decision came after doctors judged Odom, 35, was stable enough to be moved after regaining consciousness last week and continuing to recover through the weekend. The report said the two-time NBA champion remained on dialysis because of a kidney problem but had passed a swallowing test and could breathe independently. E! said Odom was communicating using hand signals. There has been an outpouring of support from his former teammates and his estranged wife Khloe Kardashian has been at his side.
