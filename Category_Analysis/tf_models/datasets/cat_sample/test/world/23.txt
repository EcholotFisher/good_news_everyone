The federal cabinet looks set to give the go-ahead for expanding Australian air strikes against Islamic State into Syria, according to the defence minister, Kevin Andrews . 
Andrews told the Weekend Australian his “inclination is to do this” although he says it was ultimately a decision for cabinet’s national security committee to make. 
“This is not a radical departure from what we are doing now; it is simply widening our area of operation,” he said. 
Government frontbencher Mitch Fifield said the Coalition party room would support an increased military commitment. 
“We know that IS don’t observe the borders that they travel from Iraq into Syria, and at the moment we’ve been prevented from continuing a mission across that border,” Fifield told Sky News. “I think my colleagues in the party room would be very comfortable with doing more to seek to defeat IS.” 
Andrews said Iraq would remain the focus of Australia’s military commitment. Six Australian F/A-18 Hornets now conduct combat missions over Iraq , along with a E-7A Wedgetail airborne warning and control aircraft and a KC-30A airborne refuelling aircraft. 
Andrews has previously said the safety of RAAF pilots and aircrew would be foremost in the government’s mind as it considered extending existing air operations over Iraq to include Syria . 
The prime minister, Tony Abbott , has already signalled his support , saying “while there is a little difference between the legalities of air strikes on either side of the border, there’s no difference in the morality”.
