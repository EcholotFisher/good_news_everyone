JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Palestinians are clashing with Israeli riot police at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site during a major Jewish holiday.
The compound is sacred to Jews and known as the Temple Mount, site of the two biblical Jewish temples. Muslims revere it as the Noble Sanctuary where they believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. It is a frequent flashpoint of violence, and Israel has beefed up security following multiple clashes in recent weeks.
Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said Palestinians threw rocks and firebombs from within the Al-Aqsa mosque at the site. Protestors had stockpiled rocks and other projectiles at the mosque overnight, she said.
It was the second day in a row of violence at the site. Monday's unrest occurred on the first day of the weeklong Jewish festival of Sukkot.
