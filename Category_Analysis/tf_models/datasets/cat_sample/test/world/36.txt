NASA has reportedly confirmed a giant asteroid will pass close to Earth this weekend. 
The Mirror is reporting NASA confirmed the asteroid - also known as 6666 (2000 FL10) - will hurtle close to Earth at 40,000 miles per hour (64,373.76km/h) and is expected to pass the moon's orbit of the Earth in the next couple of days. 
While NASA hasn't been able to confirm the asteroid's exact size, according to The Mirror it could be 1.6 miles (2.5km) wide, large enough to cause significant damage if it was to impact Earth. 
However, the Mirror says it is not thought the asteroid will come close enough to case any damage and will only be considered hazardous to Earth if it comes within 4,600,000 miles (7,402,982.4km). asteroid
