WASHINGTON, Sept. 3 (UPI) -- Longtime children's entertainment network Nickelodeon is reaching far into its archives to reconsider bringing back classic shows and characters.
The outlet -- which is home to classic series including The Ren & Stimpy Show , Rugrats and Hey Arnold! -- is looking to honor its early days 25 years after airing its first show.
"We are looking at our library to bring back ideas, shows that were loved, in a fresh new way," Nickelodeon President of content and development Russell Hicks told Variety.
Those who enjoyed the network in its earliest days, Hicks noted, now have children of their own. The comment alluded to the assumption those parents would return their families to the network in the name of nostalgia. Still, an official list of shows set for a comeback has not yet been revealed.
"We are getting ready to bring back some of the ones they've told us multiple times they want to have brought back," Hicks said.
Nickelodeon is home to other classic animated and live-action series including Doug , You Can't Do That on Television and Clarissa Explains It All.
