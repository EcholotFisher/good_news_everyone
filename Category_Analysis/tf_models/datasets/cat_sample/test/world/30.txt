Some customers in North Carolina who had their hair cut for charity are upset that their donated hair was found thrown in the trash .
Someone reportedly found the donated hair, as well as some customers' personal information, in a Dumpster behind the Great Clips hair salon in Gastonia, N.C.
Wigs for Kids, the Ohio-based charity that helps children battling cancer, was notified after employees retreived the hair, Great Clips spokesman Paul Omodt said.
Officials at Great Clips headquarters are investigating.
"What do you say to people who tried to give those donations and thought they were going to children?” Omodt said. “We apologize for the delay getting them to the children."
Omodt said about five of the hair donations were damaged, and that 95 of them could be saved.
“We know the majority of them will go to the children, and we know the charity is looking forward to getting the donations,” Omodt said.
Great Clips officials said Wednesday they will donate $5,000 to Wigs for Kids.
Although the discovery was made Tuesday, one customer said she donated her hair one year ago.
