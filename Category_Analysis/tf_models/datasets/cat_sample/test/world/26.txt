The two Republican presidential front-runners, billionaire Donald Trump and neurosurgeon Ben Carson, both took aim at Muslims last week, American Muslims in fact. 
Trump mused about secret Muslim training camps in the U.S. while Carson seemed to suggest that being a Muslim was incompatible with high U.S. office. 
"I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation," Carson told an interviewer. "I absolutely would not agree with that." 
Should a president's faith matter? he was asked. 
"Well, I guess it depends on what that faith is. If it's inconsistent with the values and principles of America, then of course it should matter. But if it fits within the realm of America and consistent with the Constitution, I've no problem."
