Guinea's minister of justice called on Guineans, especially politicians, to refrain from inciting violence or undermining the country's laws. 
Minister Cheick Sako said in a statement late Tuesday that any planned unrest will be punished by the law. 
Ethnic and political violence marked Guinea's first democratic elections in 2010. Violence before the Oct. 11 presidential vote killed at least three people. There have been some reports of unrest outside the capital since the vote and after opposition leaders said they would not recognize results because of allegations of voting fraud. 
International Criminal Court prosecutor Fatou Bensouda on Wednesday said the court is following developments in Guinea closely to see if any unrest falls under its jurisdiction. 
Guinea's election commission said results have been postponed until Friday. Copyright
