A cheating husband was filmed having sex with another woman in broad daylight - then threatened a neighbour with a knife after the footage was posted online. 
Shameless Carl Vause, 33, was outed as the man romping with a woman in the street in full view of passers-by after a video was posted in a Facebook group, a court heard. 
The married dad, from Grimsby, Lincs., and his lover only stopped when a disgusted woman complained there were children nearby, a court heard. 
Vause was named on social media after a neighbour recognised him, Grimsby Magistrates Court was told. No shame: The couple only stopped when a disgusted woman told them there were children nearby 
Holding a kitchen knife, Vause shouted at his neighbour's partner: "Where is Rick?" 
She called police and Vause was arrested. 
He told officers "you better keep an eye on me. I am going to get every one of those Facebook people" as he was led away, the court heard. 
Vause admitted threatening behaviour and was given a curfew and ordered to pay court costs of Â£325. 
The court heard the woman involved in the sex act, who has not been named, was given a police caution for outraging public decency. 
Presiding magistrate Ray Dumbleton said it was "a very sad situation". 
Prosecuting, Brendan Woodward said the sex act was recorded on a mobile phone by a man in a property nearby. 
He said: "They were approached by a woman and said that what they were doing was disgusting and in the presence of children in the area. They stopped and left the area." Google StreetView Scene: The street in Grimsby where the couple were filmed having sex 
Defending Vuase, solicitor Andrea Wilkes said he client was "ashamed" to have ended up in court. 
She said: "The female involved got a caution for outraging public decency but hers was more shocking. She had her bottom half exposed. 
"He never had his genitalia exposed or any clothing removed." 
The solicitor said her client had told police who the other woman was and her details. 
Ms Wilkes said her client had been drinking with another couple when Vause and his lover went to get items from a shop. 
She said: "There had never been any sexual tension between them before but under the influence of alcohol things got out of hand." 
Neither of them was aware they were being filmed. 
Ms Wilkes said the incident three days later stemmed from his neighbour making him aware of the footage on a website. 
She said: "She promised him that she would not tell his wife." 
But Vause went back in and told his wife, who forgave him. 
However, a short time later a comment appeared on the website with the footage, which Vause saw. 
He went out to argue with the neighbour. 
Vause told officers he only had the knife because he had been cutting meat in his kitchen and forgot he had it in his hand. 
But he accepted that his behaviour and swinging the knife may have caused his neighbour some fright. 
Ms Wilkes said her client had been suffering from mental health issues and is receiving medication for depression.
