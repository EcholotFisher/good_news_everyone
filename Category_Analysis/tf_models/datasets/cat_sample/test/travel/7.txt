Under-the-radar Sand City on the Monterey Peninsula is home to the West End Celebration, showcasing the talents of the cadre of artists who live and work in the funky, iconoclastic community. The 14-year-old festival fills streets with visual and performing arts and music meant to teach, inspire and agitate. More than a dozen resident artists will host visitors in their studios as well as mounting pop-up exhibits throughout the streets. Proceeds from a wine-tasting pavilion and a Friday night kick-off party starring blues guitarist Chris Cain (pictured at right) will raise funds for local youth-oriented nonprofits. 
Vitals: Aug. 21-23; from 7 p.m. Friday, 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday, noon-5 p.m. Sunday. Free admission; $10 wine tasting; $20-$25 kick-off party. (831) 372-1955. www.westendcelebration.com . 
Wine tasting with Fido: Humans can enjoy fine food, wine and beer, live bluegrass music and mountain scenery without a trace of separation anxiety during the annual Peaks and Paws event at the Village at Squaw Valley. Dogs will be limited to water, but guided hikes, tasty treats, a pet-themed vendor village and activities geared toward canines provide ample compensation. Aug. 22, 11 a.m.-7 p.m. $5 suggested donation; food and drink prices vary. (800) 403-0206. www.squawalpine.com (select Events & Things to Do). 
L.A.’s top tacos: Los Angeles is one of the state’s best places to find a great taco, and the LA Taco Festival, which started five years ago in Boyle Heights, will bring the best of the best to downtown’s Grand Park this year. A benefit for homeless youth, the gathering features a nonstop music lineup, food trucks (and not just tacos) and other vendors. Bring lawn chairs, sunscreen and hearty appetites.
