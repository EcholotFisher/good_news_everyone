Tree disease has had a huge impact on the British countryside in the past 100 years. More than 25 million elm trees succumbed to Dutch elm disease, while Chalara dieback of ash now threatens more than 130 million ash trees. Over the past 10 years, 18 new pests and diseases have been confirmed in the UK. But where do these diseases come from and why have they become so prevalent in modern times? It is thought that some diseases spread through spores carried large distances on the wind. However, pests and diseases are also being brought into this country with imported plants, timber materials and even in packing materials. Exotic plants are increasingly popular, with the value of imported plants rising from £197m to £340m between 2000 and 2008. It is estimated that 80 per cent of our wood products are imported. Our trees have also been weakened by pollution, intensive land use, urban development and climate change, all of which leave them less able to fight new diseases or pests. Major problem: like other species, Chinese water deer have few natural predators The Woodland Trust’s head of conservation Christine Reid says: “We are experiencing warmer summers and milder winters, which are enabling a different range of pests to come to this country. “The oak processionary moth is a good example. It’s generally found in Mediterranean climates, but is now able to survive in southern England.” It is also much harder for trees to regenerate naturally. The number of deer and grey squirrels eating young trees has risen rapidly in the past 15 years. Non-native species of deer such as the muntjac and Chinese water deer are thriving in the UK. Unless significant action is taken, our landscape and livelihoods will be changed forever Christine Reid adds: "Deer are a major problem for woodlands because as older trees are killed of by disease, they will not be naturally replaced." As an island nation, the UK has been naturally protected to a certain extent but even the 20 miles or so of sea separating us from mainland Europe can be breached by some pests. Cut off: Britain's landscapes will change if tree diseases are not prevented If they do arrive on these islands, they arrive without the natural enemies higher up the food chain they would encounter in their native country. Once here, a new pest has access to a range of host plants (including our native species) which may have little or no natural resistance, because they have not had time to adapt. When that is added to the already weakened state of some trees, pests and disease are able to take hold in a way that was not possible until recently. The Government banned importing ash trees into the UK in October 2012 in a bid to stop the spread of highly infectious ash dieback fungus. It was first found in this country – in a nursery in Buckinghamshire – eight months earlier. The number of deer and grey squirrels eating young trees has risen rapidly in the past 15 years However, ash dieback spreads easily on the wind and can naturally travel tens of kilometres while also being carried on clothing, footwear and vehicles. This makes the disease very difficult to contain. Similar factors have enabled diseases including Dutch elm disease, acute oak decline and Phytophthora ramorum to take hold in the UK. Unless significant action is taken, our landscape and livelihoods will be changed forever.
