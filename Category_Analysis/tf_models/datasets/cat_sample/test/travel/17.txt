VERNON, B.C. — The NHL’s biggest stars will soon be reporting for training camp. 
For the rest of us … er … amateur athletes, that simply means extra openings on the tee-sheet at Predator Ridge Resort near Vernon, B.C. 
The 36-hole hot-spot in the Okanagan Valley is the official summer home of Hockey Canada and hosted the NHL Players’ Association Golf Classic in July, and it’s certainly not uncommon to spot one of your favourite pucksters digging divots on the Predator or Ridge loops during the off-season months. 
“Our continual association with hockey and hockey players is expanding,” said Dick Zokol, a former PGA Tour regular — and winner of the 1992 Greater Milwaukee Open — and now a golf and real estate specialist at Predator Ridge. “I’ve been talking to a couple of them because they’re thinking of moving here.” 
Can you blame them? 
SCOREGolf Magazine revealed its latest ranking of Canada’s Top 59 Public Courses earlier this summer, and you didn’t have to scan far down the list to find both of the offerings at Predator Ridge. 
The Predator Course, a challenging, linksy layout that was mapped out by Canmore’s Les Furber, checked in at No. 19. 
The Doug Carrick-designed Ridge Course, which is a little more forgiving and features some spectacular views of Lake Okanagan, was eighth. 
Other amenities at Predator Ridge include indoor and outdoor pools, kilometres and kilometres of walking trails and access to the spa at nearby Sparkling Hill Resort. 
If you’re not shopping for a second property, you can instead stay at Predator Ridge Lodge — just steps from the first tee of either course — or book a cottage or villa. 
There are also multiple dining options on-site, although you should sneak away to visit one of the Okanagan’s many wineries for a tasting. 
“There’s nothing like this in all of Canada, with all of the amenities,” Zokol said. “Nobody can compete with what we’re offering, in the whole nation. And I mean nobody.” 
If that sounds familiar, it could be because your neighbour, co-worker or one of your golf pals was bragging about a recent trip to Predator Ridge, which is just over six hours of drive-time west of Calgary. 
And if you haven’t been? 
Well … as long as your boss isn’t Bob Hartley, the fall could be the ideal time to find out what all the fuss is about. Both courses at Predator Ridge will remain open until after Thanksgiving long weekend. 
“It needs to be experienced to be appreciated — simple as that,” Zokol said. 
“Most people, I just tell them you have to see it to believe it,” agreed former LPGA Tour player A.J. Eathorne, who was born in Calgary, raised in the Okanagan and is now head of instruction at Predator Ridge. “And that’s so true. You can tell them how beautiful it is and that the golf courses are great and the views are great and all the rest, but you have to really be here and touch it and feel it to get the best of it. 
“And once people are here, we hear a lot of, ‘Wow, this is awesome.’ It’s just so relaxing. The service is great. People are just so happy to be here … 
“It’s like an adult Disneyland.” 
It’s not unusual for Stanley Cup winners to shout ‘I’m going to Disneyland!’ after getting their fingers on the NHL’s ultimate prize. 
Truth is, they might be headed to Predator Ridge instead.
