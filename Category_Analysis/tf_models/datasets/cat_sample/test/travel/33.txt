MIAMI, FL - Carnival Cruise Line brought its spirited brand of fun to this year's Taste of Atlanta festival, hosting an exclusive Dr Seuss-themed book reading and cooking demonstration for local children with Atlanta Braves announcer Brian Jordan. 
Modeled after the cruise line's fleetwide Seuss at Sea program operated in conjunction with Dr. Seuss Enterprises, the event featured the former two-sport star of the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Falcons reading the Dr. Seuss classic "Green Eggs and Ham" to dozens of aspiring chefs from the Atlanta-based Young Chefs Academy. 
After the book reading, Jordan and Carnival Chef Roshan D'Souza conducted a cooking demonstration of Dr. Seuss-themed dishes served as part of the Green Eggs and Ham Breakfast with The Cat in the Hat and Friends, one of the many activities available within Carnival's Seuss at Sea program. 
The book reading and cooking demonstration were part of the cruise line's sponsorship of the Family Food Zone renamed Carnival Kids' Corner for this year's festival. 
"Fostering a passion for activities like reading and cooking is something I believe has the power to inspire learning and creativity among kids in Atlanta and across the nation," said Jordan. "I am honored to be part of this wonderful event and read a classic book from my childhood, 'Green Eggs and Ham,' so that kids of this generation can appreciate how fun and enriching reading can be," he added. In conjunction with the event, Carnival made a donation to Jordan's charity, The Brian Jordan Foundation, which helps children and their families improve their quality of life. 
The Carnival Kids' Corner programming offered a variety of fun activities, as well as complimentary cooking demonstrations, with Chef D'Souza teaming up with locally and nationally-celebrated chefs to prepare simple, healthy dishes for children and their families. 
"Creating delicious meals and entertaining is an integral part of the Carnival cruise experience, and something we love to share with our guests," said D'Souza. "We were thrilled to be able to offer demonstrations at Taste of Atlanta of recipes that families can recreate at home or enjoy aboard our ships," he added. 
Carnival is the number one cruise line for families, carrying more than 700,000 kids annually.
