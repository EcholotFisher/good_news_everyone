Sydney has again been voted the number one city in Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific in the 20th annual Travel + Leisure 2015 World’s Best Awards in the USA.
Minister for Trade, Tourism and Major Events Stuart Ayres said it is a fantastic achievement.
“This once again shows what an amazing world city Sydney is, with its iconic landmarks, stunning beaches, vibrant food and wine scene, and world-class events that all continue to resonate with the readers of Travel + Leisure,” Mr Ayres said.
In addition, Sydney properties dominated the Top Hotels category, taking out four of the top five positions, with the Four Seasons Hotel in Sydney named the number one hotel in Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific.
The Park Hyatt Sydney, Intercontinental Sydney and Sydney Harbour Marriott Hotel at Circular Quay also placed in the top five, reflecting the incredible standards in the State’s accommodation sector.
“The USA is an important visitor market for NSW with the State welcoming more than 63 per cent of all visitors to Australia from the USA in the year ending December 2014. This acknowledgement from the readers of Travel + Leisure reinforces the enduring appeal of Sydney,” Mr Ayres added.
Destination NSW Chief Executive Officer Sandra Chipchase welcomed the accolade from the prestigious lifestyle magazine.
“Once again Sydney continues to stand out against its international rivals with our city and our hotels a cut above the rest,” Ms Chipchase said.
