Because of the many people around the world who arrive to Florence, the city has taken an increasingly international character, in part by absorbing some characteristic features of the big cities in the world despite being a small town. Among the various features that Florence has acquired hosting more than ten million tourists each year is the great entertainment for those who want to have fun at night. The streets and squares of Florence have animated the presence of local places and events dedicated to those who want to spend hours of fun especially at night. At night the central areas are full of Florentines and tourists who move towards the city at night. Night restaurants, pubs, clubs and disco bar become a substitute for museums and major monuments and become the preferred destination for those who spend the night with friends. There are also many concerts that are organized in different locations where groups and singers more or less famous of all musical genres can perform. A couple of times a year there are also the so called "white nights" where the town and the business activities of the historic center of Florence stay open during most of the night, creating a range of exceptional events: music, art, culture, organization of entertainment even for children accompanied by their parents. It is a very similar event to New Year's Eve.
