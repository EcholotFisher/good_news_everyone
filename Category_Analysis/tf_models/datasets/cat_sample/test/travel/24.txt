A junction with 42 traffic lights ran more smoothly when a malfunction made all the lights go out, according to local motorists and residents. All the lights at Grovehill junction in Beverley, East Yorkshire - which are supposed to manage 20 different traffic movements and nine crossing points - went out following a power failure. The junction replaced a roundabout when the town’s bypass opened in February. The lights have been blamed for causing unnecessary tailbacks in the area, which has been nicknamed the “red light district”. Peter Robinson, 78, who has lived nearby since 1969, said the road has been blighted with traffic problems since the lights were installed. “The traffic has been moving much better than when the lights are on and there doesn’t seem to be any problems,” he said. “Everyone seems quite confident going through the junction without the lights. There’s no tailbacks.” Time since the first traffic light was installed Anita Tomlinson, a resident of the same road, said: “The traffic has been flowing very well since the lights went out, it’s flowing like it used to do when it was just a roundabout. I had wondered myself what would happen if all 42 lights went out but drivers are being very careful.” Terry Fawcett, another resident, added: “We had a perfectly good roundabout before, that functioned as a roundabout should.” • Gadget which turns all traffic lights green trialled in UK The traffic lights went out on Tuesday morning and remained off yesterday. A spokesman for East Riding of Yorkshire council said: “The fault with the control box for the traffic lights at this junction has been of a significant nature, and is taking some time to repair. “So far most drivers have taken extra care and remained patient whilst using the junction. However, as the pedestrian crossing facilities are not working, drivers are requested to proceed with caution.” • Vienna replaces pedestrian traffic light figures with gay couples Traffic lights through the ages 1869, London Manual traffic control device introduced.
