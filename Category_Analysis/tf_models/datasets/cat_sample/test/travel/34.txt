Better Business Bureaus nationally have received 51 complaints and 1,449 inquiries about justfly.com since March 5, 2015. Complaints are primarily from customers in the United States, and the complaints specifically allege: • Differences in the quoted price as opposed to what is actually charged on the consumer’s credit card after booking. • Mistakes being made by booking agents, such as the name and spelling of the passenger’s name. Adjustments to the booking results in significant fees to the consumer from both the airline and justfly.com. • Differences in the time and date of travel from the original booking. • Not receiving email booking confirmations as promised. • Reports of being on hold for excessive periods of time when calling into the customer service department. Some have reported being cut off eventually. • Being charged more for a cancellation fee than was originally quoted. “Based on a similar business model, a similar pattern of complaints and the same name of one of the people responding to complaints, BBB believes the company is connected with FlightHub, which had its accreditation revoked by another BBB,” said Kitt Letcher, president and CEO of Better Business Bureau of Central Oklahoma. “If you plan on using either of these websites to book airline tickets, it’s best to make informed decisions and to protect yourself as much as possible by purchasing travel from reputable companies that provide good customer service.” FlightHub presently has 323 closed complaints since April 2013 and 29 complaints that are still pending. Better Business Bureau of Central Oklahoma is offering the following advice when booking online travel: • Buy flights directly from the airline or a local travel agency and start your research with www.oklahomacity.bbb.org .
