NEW YORK , Aug. 31, After experiencing a slump for many years following 9/11 and the global recession, the global airline industry has been experiencing very strong growth in the last 3-4 years. The 2014 brought about excellent results for the global airline industry followed by rising air fares along with a boost in passenger growth as well.
While the airline industry dealt with a spate of major airline accidents such as the MH370, MH17 and the Germanwings crash, airlines continued to focus on increasing security and boosting features to ensure higher passenger safety. However, the Asian market did witness a slowdown in travel primarily owing to these disasters as well as a military coup in Thailand .
The industry boosted revenues through partnerships and alliances and higher fees by charging for ancillary services such as fees for baggage, extra amenities, ticket changes, frequent flyer programs, etc. Domestic travel continued to be the leading segment of the global airline industry accounting for nearly 60% of the entire industry, followed by international travel, accounting for just over 40%.
The United States , China , Russia , United Kingdom and Germany had some of the world's largest fleets in the years 2013 and 2014. Emerging markets such as Latin America and Asia Pacific remained the high growth markets for aircraft manufacturers.
