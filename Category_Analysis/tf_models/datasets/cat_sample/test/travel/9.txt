DALLAS, TX - Virgin America, the airline known for low fares and upscale service, today announced a new partnership with the Frontiers of Flight Museum at Dallas Love Field (DAL) and unveiled its new exhibit chronicling the airline's effort to bring its award-winning product and service to DAL. As part of the new partnership, the airline will help provide scholarships for students attending the Flight School and other educational programs at the museum. Virgin America announced the new partnership today along with airline teammates, museum officials and local 5-6th grade students participating in the Flight School program at an unveiling of the airline's new exhibit. 
"Since first launching service in the Dallas Metroplex in 2010, Virgin America has been committed to supporting community organizations and educational programs like the Frontiers of Flight Museum's Flight School," said Virgin America's Chief Operating Officer, Steve Forte. "This museum houses a rich aviation history and it's truly an honor to unveil our exhibit today and share it with fellow aviation enthusiasts." 
Through its partnership with the Frontiers of Flight Museum, Virgin America will provide scholarships for students enrolled in the organization's Flight School and other educational programs that offer a unique learning environment for students of all ages, designed to apply STEM principals to the area of aviation and space flight through guided museum tours and classroom educational programs. This summer, Virgin America provided scholarships to 50 students to participate in the Flight School program. 
Also as part of the extended partnership, Virgin America's exhibit was unveiled during a commemorative ribbon cutting ceremony and tells the story of the airline's entrance at Dallas Love Field, including May 2014's public advocacy campaign at www.FreeLoveField.com , where more than 28,000 travelers have voiced their support of free-market competition, low fares and more choice at Love Field. The Virgin America exhibit also displays the original "Love Letter to Love Field" written by Sir Richard Branson, photographs from the airline's launch festivities at Dallas Love Field on October 13, 2014 and video highlights of Virgin America's eight-year history. 
"We are very excited about having this remarkable exhibit in our Love Field Gallery," said Cheryl Sutterfield-Jones, President and CEO of the Frontiers of Flight Museum. "Our partnership with Virgin America is instrumental to our mission of inspiring students of all backgrounds to excel in science, technology, engineering, and math."
