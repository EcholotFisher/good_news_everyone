AFP/Getty Images A Carlyle Group LP hedge fund that anticipated a sudden currency-policy shift in China gained roughly $100 million in two days last week, a sign of how some bearish bets on the world’s second-largest economy are starting to pay off.
The 75% return for Emerging Sovereign Group’s Nexus fund developed after China unexpectedly pushed the value of the yuan lower on Aug. 11, according to people familiar with the matter. It was the nation’s biggest devaluation in two decades.
The sudden paper gains propelled the ESG hedge fund to a roughly 50% year-to-date return through mid-August, after fees. The surge also helped the fund recover from losses earlier in the year. Through the end of July, it had lost 11%, one of the people said.
China has become an increasingly popular target for short bets that asset values will deteriorate. But limited foreign access to the country’s equity and bond markets means there aren’t many ways to bet on outright declines in those markets, and the methods that do exist tend to be small and illiquid.
Nexus, led by former fixed-income salesman Brian McCarthy, instead focused on betting against China’s currency. The fund purchased a string of put options that gave it the right to sell the currency at preset prices, within agreed-upon time frames. Nexus was able to buy those options on the cheap over time because most investors expected Beijing to support the yuan rather than let it fall.
