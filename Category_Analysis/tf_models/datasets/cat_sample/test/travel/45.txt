MANILA, Philippines – Cebu Pacific Air, the Philippines’ largest airline, concluded its first #CEBjuanderers Challenge, with bloggers from Japan emerging as the winners. 
Ikuma Nakagawa and Hidekazu Tanaka from Team Japan competed against teams of two bloggers each from Korea, China and Australia, and ranked the highest in special fun challenges held in the Philippines’ top tourist destinations. 
Organised in partnership with the Philippine Tourism Promotions Board, the #CEBJuanderers competed in a series of surprise challenges from 1 to 7 August 2015. They flew on trapezes in Manila and cooked up a feast in Palawan. They participated in energetic dance-offs in Cebu and adrenaline-pumping ziplines and sky cycles in Davao. The challenge ended on the white sandy beaches of Boracay where the #CEBJuanderers had a ball of a time playing football. They also took part in a Fan’s Choice bartending challenge, as voted by Cebu Pacific’s Facebook fans. 
Apart from the challenges, they also toured the Puerto Princesa Underground River, one of the New7Wonders of Nature, and went island hopping in Boracay. 
“I can’t believe we did so much in just seven days, you don’t feel tired when you’re having so much fun and making wonderful memories! I’ll never forget the wonderful hospitality of the Philippine people and my time as a CEB Juanderer. The challenges were so much fun, and I can’t wait to come back to Philippines again as Team Japan won! The Philippines is a great undiscovered travel destination that all Japanese should explore!” said Ikuma Nakagawa. 
“Over the past week I have found the Philippines to be wonderful place, which is now very close to my heart. The country is full of beautiful natural sights as well as warm and welcoming people. It was wonderful to meet all my fellow CEB Juanderers and I would like to thank everyone who helped us along the way” said Hidekazu Tanaka. 
“It was fantastic to see all the fun and excitement of the Philippines captured through the eyes of the Juanderers. We hope that as more people see what an incredible time they had, they would be also be inspired to create their own adventures and ‘Juander’ across the Philippines with Cebu Pacific’s excellent domestic and international network,” said CEB VP for Marketing and Distribution Candice Iyog. 
Each member of the winning team received an all-expense paid holiday to any destination in the Philippines for two people, inclusive of flights, two nights hotel accommodation and USD300 travel allowance. All Juanderers will also be holding “The #CEBjuanderers Fans’ Photo Contest” on their social media platforms, where their fans back home will stand a chance to win a pair of return tickets to a direct destination in the Philippines.
