Marriott International Creates Two Epic Super Bowl 50 Fan Experiences
In anticipation of one of the biggest events in the history of the NFL, Marriott International is changing the game for lucky fans with an epic season long Super Bowl 50 campaign. Courtyard, the Official Hotel of the NFL for the past four years, is adding to its tradition of unique NFL experiences by hosting the world’s first Super Bowl “Suite Stadium Contest” sleepover in Levi’s Stadium. Marriott Rewards, the company’s award-winning loyalty program, launches its “50 to 50″ campaign that includes a sweepstakes which gives members in three countries a once-in-a-lifetime chance to take a group of 50 of their friends and family to attend the game and enjoy an exclusive VIP Super Bowl 50 weekend in the San Francisco Bay area.
“The NFL is the powerhouse of professional sports, and our long-standing sponsorship gives us an opportunity to tap into a passionate group of travelers, bringing the breadth and depth of our brand offerings to fans,” said Karin Timpone, Global Marketing Officer, Marriott International. “Similar to our relationships with global leaders in the music and entertainment industry, our NFL sponsorship represents the company’s ongoing effort to bring exclusive and memorable experiences for our guests and the 52 million members of our Marriott Rewards program.”
“Marriott provides unique and interactive experiences that have resonated with football fans across the country,” said Renie Anderson, senior vice president of sponsorship, NFL. “We are pleased to work with Marriott to reach our fans in authentic and innovative ways, especially leading up to Super Bowl 50.”
