Misplaced camera travels the world before being returned Roxanne Mccarty-Oâ€™Kane | 20th Oct 2015 5:00 AM SNAP HAPPY: Peter Rosendale (right) is lucky to have his camera returned by Greg Pitman after he left it in a store while holidaying in America. Warren Lynam   
THIS small, Sony camera travelled the world while its owner was hard at work in Nambour. 
Nambour Print Centre owners Peter and Jeannie Rosendale filled their camera with priceless memories as they ventured to the world's largest air show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, took in the Harley Davidson Museum in Milwaukee and strolled through Beverley Hills and Hollywood. 
Mr Rosendale thought they were lost forever when he discovered the camera missing. 
"I was annoyed with myself because I couldn't remember where I'd left it, so I rang around the places we'd been to and no one had it," he said. 
"On the long flight home I kept hoping it was right down the bottom of the bag." 
On unpacking, he discovered that wasn't the case and decided to call the Californian stores again in case it had surfaced. 
Amazingly, he struck gold. 
It was sitting beside the counter of a major pharmacy at Manhattan Beach. 
"On the last day of the holiday, I'd decided to buy a pack of razors and I'd left it on the counter where I paid for them," he said. 
The next two weeks were filled with phone calls trying to make arrangements to have the camera sent back to Australia. 
"I was happy to pay to get it over here, but they didn't seem to get anything happening," Mr Rosendale said. 
"I was beginning to think it was all getting very difficult when Greg Pitman walked in to have some maps of the USA copied for his upcoming holiday." 
Prompted by his wife, Mr Rosendale recounted their story of loss and Mr Pitman offered to collect the camera on his holiday. 
He spent an hour on the bus, with a changeover at LAX Airport, to finally track it down. 
"I set about posting it back to him, but FedEx wanted $130 and the US postal service wanted $54, so I ended up taking it with me around the world," Mr Pitman said. 
With the camera in tow, he travelled to Panama, Barcelona, Lisbon, Zurich and Thailand over six weeks before returning the camera to its grateful owners. 
While he was thrilled to get his camera back, Mr Rosendale said he found it ironic it had enjoyed a more extensive holiday than he had. misplaced camera
