A Guerin Prep High School administrator has been arrested for allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with a student off campus.
The 34-year-old assistant principal at the River Grove high school was arrested Wednesday by members of the Chicago Police Department's Special Investigations Unit on accusations of aggravated sexual abuse of a childaccording to a Chicago Police Department spokeswoman. Charges had not been filed as of Thursday afternoon, the spokeswoman said.
The man allegedly had inappropriate contact with a 17-year-old Guerin Prep student on Sept. 20 in the 2600 block of North Sayre Avenue in Chicago's Galewood neighborhood, according to police.
While working at Guerin, the assistant principal was also the musical director at St. William Catholic Church, located at 2600 N. Sayre Ave., the block where the alleged incident took place.
The Archdiocese of Chicago acknowledged the arrest in an emailed statement.
"The Archdiocese of Chicago is aware of the situation and can confirm that the situation was properly reported to [the Department of Children and Family Services]," the statement said. "We are monitoring the situation and will continue to cooperate with the civil authorities."
Steve Baldwin, principal of Guerin Prep High School, said his assistant principal had held the position for six years. Once the school found out about the allegations, Baldwin said the school put the assistant principal on paid administrative leave.
Baldwin believes that the alleged actions, if true, are isolated to an outside occurrence and nothing within the school.
"We certainly believe this does not go beyond that," Baldwin said.
River Grove Director of Police Rodger Loni said that the assistant principal hadn't had any run-ins with law enforcement in River Grove.
"There's never been an allegation or problem here in River Grove as we know," Loni said. "His record is clean."
Still, Guerin has made counselors available to students. Baldwin said the school's faculty, students, parents and those closely affiliated with school have been notified about the allegations and the school will continue to work with police.
Baldwin said all those who work at the school knew what was required of them, including the assistant principal
"He was our assistant principal, and we hold him and the rest of our staff to a higher standard," Baldwin said.
