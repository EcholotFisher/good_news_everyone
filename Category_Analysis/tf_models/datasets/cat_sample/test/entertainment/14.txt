Cory Wells, one of the three lead singers of the classic-pop hitmakers Three Dog Night, died Tuesday, the band announced today.
"It is with deep sadness and disbelief that I must report the passing of Cory Wells, my beloved band mate for over 45 years," co-lead Danny Hutton said in a statement. "Cory was an incredible singer â€“ a great performer, he could sing anything."
Wells, 74, died "unexpectedly" in Dunkirk, N.Y, according to the statement from Universal Music, which oversees the band's catalog. He had quit touring in September after developing "a problem with severe back pain."
"Cory was like a brother in so many ways," said Hutton. "We had been together since 1965 and I am in shock at this sudden loss."
Three Dog Night was a staple on the oldies circuit, playing Las Vegas every year or two. They played The Cannery last June and in 2013, and the Fremont Street Experience in 2009.
The original group played the Las Vegas Convention Center in January 1970 in its breakout days of fame, on the heels of the singles "One," "Easy to be Hard' and "Eli's Coming."
Since the mid-1980s, the group was fronted by Wells and Hutton. The third original singer, Chuck Negron, tours separately as a solo act. Jimmy Greenspoon, the group's keyboardist from its original albums, died earlier this year of melanoma.
The group's hits include "Celebrate," "Joy to the World," "Mama Told Me (Not to Come)," "Black & White" and "Shambala."
Wells was born Emil Lewandowski on February 2, 1941. His early success with a Los Angeles band called The Enemys led to a meeting with Hutton when both went tour with Sonny and Cher, and the idea to form a group with three lead singers.
