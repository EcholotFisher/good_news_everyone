The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston formally broke ground Thursday for its expanding Fayez S. Sarofim Campus.
At the edge of the site where the Glassell School of Art's new building will rise, donors heard museum chairman Rich Kinder, director Gary Tinterow, architect Steven Holl, donor Alfred C. Glassell III and BBVA Compass president Manolo Sánchez extol the institution's benefits.
The new school building is scheduled to open in 2017; in the meantime, its students are in several temporary quarters.
Tinterow noted that the museum began as "an art school without walls" and hosted its first six classes in 1927 in the basement of its original William Ward Watkin building. It is still the only museum school of its kind in the nation, serving students of all ages and levels.
Philanthropist Alfred C. Glassell, Jr. funded the school's first official home in 1979. That iconic concrete and glass block building by Eugene Aubry and R. Nolen Willis was recently demolished to make way for Holl's new building, which will be twice as large and state-of-the-art.
Joseph Havel, the school's director, saw the site scraped for the first time Thursday. "You can start to imagine something really exciting is going to happen," he said.
Sánchez said BBVA Compass made its largest donation ever — $8 million — to fund the school's new roof garden. "It's a way of bringing the art outside of the museum walls," he said.
He also introduced a group of students from Eliot Elementary in the East End. "We recognize the life-changing power of art and strive to make it accessible to everybody in our communities... Kids are the future of our city," Sánchez said.
A few slabs of the sandblasted concrete that will form the new school's walls stood behind the podium. "Those pieces are in the spirit of simplicity and directness of the Mies van der Rohe building across the street," Holl explained. "They're the structural supports. As an educational building, it tells you how it's made."
Deborah Nevins & Associates will design the campus' new landscape, including the Brown Foundation Plaza between the new Glassell, the existing Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen sculpture garden and the still-to-come Nancy and Rich Kinder building for modern and contemporary art. (That ground breaking is still two years away.) "Her brief is simple but daunting: To knit together our numerous buildings and create an urban pedestrian experience like no other in Houston," Tinterow said.
Kinder said the entire 14-acre transformation, which also includes a new conservation center, will drive creative capital and business development in Houston. He expects the Sarofim Campus to generate about $335 million in economic activity during its first 20 years, including more than $2.5 million in direct, indirect and induced city tax revenues.
