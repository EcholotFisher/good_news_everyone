LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Harry Connick Jr. is adding the title of daytime show host to his resume.
The jazzman, actor and "American Idol" judge will host a new syndicated program set to debut in fall 2016.
NBC Universal Domestic Television Distribution said Tuesday it has sold the show, titled "Harry," to Fox-owned TV stations in 17 U.S. markets.
The show also is being sold to other station groups, according to NBC Universal Domestic TV, which is producing it.
The "Harry" show will be a variety program for the "new millennium," combining comedy, live musical performances and stunts, NBC Universal said.
