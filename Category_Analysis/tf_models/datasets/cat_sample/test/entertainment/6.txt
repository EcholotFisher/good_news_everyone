T HERE is no doubt the music industry is changing at a rapid pace. 
Digital charts, downloads, YouTube and Vevo channels and social media all now play key roles in the careers of international artists. 
But I don't think our reality singing shows are keeping up with the times. 
Really, when you look back there hasn't been a talent show since Australian Idol that has put out a truly successful recording artist. 
Several of Idol's finalists and runners-up - think Guy Sebastian, Jessica Mauboy and Matt Corby - are now living out their music dreams. 
The four winners of The Voice and the past winners of The X-Factor haven't enjoyed such sustained mainstream success, except for maybe Reece Mastin. 
Similarly, Justice Crew is the one musical success story out of the seven seasons of Australia's Got Talent. 
The contestants on our current talent shows are treated as such disposable commodities that they're forgotten quickly by the public. 
I bet you could name this year's four celebrity mentors on The Voice, but could you name the four singers who made it to the grand final? 
It also doesn't help that they're overshadowed by the profiles and personalities of their famous mentors. 
Sure, big names attract eyeballs, but when they're given too much attention, they detract from what is supposed to be the primary purpose of these shows - to be a springboard for fresh, raw talent. 
Arguments between celebrity mentors on The Voice and, more recently, The X-Factor, have been making the headlines - not the performances by the contestants. 
It was frustrating earlier this week to hear James Blunt say his so-called feud with Dannii Minogue on the X-Factor was distracting, and then minutes later see him get into another row with Chris Isaak. 
I'm not saying Ten should bring back Idol, but talented young singers need more than just lip service. reality tv
