ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended an event hosted by Mind, a mental health charity, on Saturday (October 10) to mark World Mental Health Day. Mind provides advice and support to empower anyone experiencing a mental health problem. Every year the charity helps over 7,000 local people with assistance from over 100 volunteers, according to organisers of the event, held at London's Harrow College. William and Kate participated in a chat group and workshop, and spoke with young people who used to battle with mental health problems and had now become volunteers with the anti-stigma campaign to raise awareness about mental health with other young people.  //reut.rs/1ZqpiGc
