ANITA Dobson gets embarrassed when she stumbles across porn on TV. 
The 66-year-old actress - the wife of Queen rocker Brian May - tries to avoid adult entertainment but says there's so much erotica available now she often finds herself tuning into 'accidental porn'. 
During a conversation about modern X-rated viewing habits on 'Loose Women', Anita confessed: "I must say I was in Stratford-upon-Avon a few years back doing a show and after the show I went home and put the TV on. I was having a cup of coffee you know, there's not much on is there? So you're flicking channels and I did come across what we call nowadays 'accidental porn'. But as they were doing a 'Midsummer's Night Dream' I figured it was OK!" 
The subject was a topic on the programme and the former 'EastEnders' star - who was joined on the panel by Ruth Langsford, Andrea McLean and Linda Robinson - gawped at the fact that one in three young women now admits to watching porn at least once a week. 
Asked whether she knew anyone who watched it regularly, Anita said: "Well I don't know - I don't go round asking people whether they watch porn! And I don't actually watch it every week, but nowadays you can put the TV on and there's Sexcetera (TV channel) and there's naked bodies, you know randomly just on." anita dobson
