CARA Delevingne hates when fans ask her for a photograph when she's trying to wipe her bottom. 
The model-turned-actress is always happy to pose for shots with her admirers but she wishes people wouldn't hassle her for a snap when she's trying to do her business on the toilet. 
Asked if she ever gets annoyed with certain 'selfie' requests, Cara told The Sunday Times newspaper: "I think when you're eating or when you're in a bathroom. 
"I've had it when I've been in a toilet cubicle and someone's gone, 'Can I get a picture?' I'm wiping my bum!" 
Cara is an avid Instagram user and she likes to try and lean on the photo-sharing site to help "troubled teenagers" by giving them an insight into her "normal" life. 
The 23-year-old star - who recently appeared in the Joe Wright-directed movie 'Pan' - said: "For me, I wanted to make people see that I was just like anyone else and also I like to use it [Instagram] when I'm not happy about things. 
"I like to speak my mind. And it works. And I've made a lot of funny relationships with fans and other people through that, so that's nice. There are a lot of troubled teenagers in the world who need a talking-to." bang showbiz
