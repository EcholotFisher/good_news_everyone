Tom Hiddleston has revealed he is not a fan of watching horror films, despite starring in one himself. 
The Thor actor, who plays the charming and refined bachelor Sir Thomas Sharpe in Guillermo del Toro’s gothic horror tale Crimson Peak, admitted he finds it difficult to sit through a creepy thriller. 
“I’ve always enjoyed ghost stories, but I’m not great with horror myself, as an audience member,” he said, adding he still finds the “profoundly disturbing” Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang “terrifying”. 
“It sounds crazy but I used to be scared by the child catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. It’s not really a ghost story but it’s a profoundly disturbing character and I saw it again on YouTube recently and I still think it’s terrifying.” 
The 34-year-old star – whose big-screen credits include villain Loki in the Marvel movies, War Horse and Woody Allen’s Midnight In Paris – said he has been kept up at night with some bizarre goings-on in real life. 
“I have had weird experiences actually, but I do think they’re projections of my own imagination. So I do wake up and I’m creeped out, I turn my light on and look under the bed,” Tom said. 
“But then the next morning, you tell the story over breakfast and you go, ‘I’m such an idiot’, something’s going on up here [he taps his head], rather than anything else.” Tom Hiddleston, Mia Wasikowska and Guillermo del Toro (Francois Mori/AP) 
Tom’s role was originally ear-marked for his friend, Benedict Cumberbatch. Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain also star in Crimson Peak. 
“I think he was attached and just couldn’t make his schedule work out. Actually, I don’t know why he dropped out but he did and it meant that Guillermo had to find someone to play the role and he came to me,” the actor explained. 
“But he also rewrote the role a little bit, which is amazing of him, to make it more custom-made for me in some way.” Share article
