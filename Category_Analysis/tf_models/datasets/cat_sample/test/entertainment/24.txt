Wiz Khalifa mocked his weekend citation for peeing in public. The rapper posted on his Instagram page two photos of himself whizzing against a wall, one of which was very graphic as it showed him actually urinating. "Have a great day," Wiz wrote in companion to a photo. He then captioned the other photo with, "I just love nature."

He was caught by police whizzing outside a popular bar in the city called The Flatz in the early hours. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has confirmed his citation, but provided no further details to the press. A number of Wiz's fans, in fact, have slammed him for not only being busted for public urination but also for mocking it. Wiz actually grew up in Pittsburgh and still has a home nearby. He was there to perform for Pitt's Midnight Madness basketball season kickoff the day prior.
