ADELE has confirmed her long-awaited third studio album '25' will be released November 20. 
The 'Skyfall' hitmaker shared the LP's artwork today (22.10.15) on her newly created Instagram account and finally put to rest industry speculation regarding the date it will drop. 
Alongside a black and white close-up photograph of the London-born singer - where her almond eyes are minimally decorated with eye-liner and mascara and her short bob can be seen tucked behind her ears - the star wrote: "25 out November 20th (sic)" 
Four years after the release of '21', the 'Rolling In The Deep' singer explained '25' is a "make-up" record as opposed to a "break-up" LP. 
In an open letter posted to her Facebook page on Wednesday (21.10.15), Adele wrote: "Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. 25 is about getting to know who I've become without realising. And I'm sorry it took so long but, you know, life happened." 
The record's first single 'Hello' will get its first radio play at 8am on Friday (23.10.15) on Nick Grimshaw's BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show.
