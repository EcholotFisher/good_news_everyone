KHLOE Kardashian and Lamar Odom have officially called off their divorce. 
The 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' star's lawyer Laura Wasser appeared before a judge in Los Angeles this morning and asked to withdraw court papers the couple signed in July to legally dissolve their marriage. 
The judge immediately granted the request after Wasser presented a dismissal document signed by both parties, according to gossip website TMZ.com. 
Khloé filed for divorce from Lamar, 35, in December 2013 following months of rumours he was addicted to drugs and cheating on her, but delayed signing the papers until last summer in the hopes of rekindling their relationship. 
She previously admitted: "I love Lamar to death. He is the love of my life. We had a fantastic marriage. Do I wish he had tried harder? Yes. Do I think that he maybe didn't have the energy to fight because he was fighting so many other things? Yeah." 
Their divorce was never finalised due to a backlog at the courthouse, but the judge was expected to sign off on it by the end of this year. 
Khloé only recently cut contact with Lamar but rushed to be by the former L.A. Lakers player's side after he was found unconscious at a brothel in Nevada last week following a four-day drugs and alcohol binge before putting her four-month romance with James Harden on hold. 
An insider claims the 31-year-old beauty has privately vowed to continue to support Lamar and they both agreed to give their marriage another chance in recent days. divorce
