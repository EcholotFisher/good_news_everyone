If Howard Stern were interviewing Howard Stern, getting himself to open up the way he does with anyone who enters his satellite radio studio, there's a good chance everyone would know by now.
A little more than two months remain on Stern's contract, and even Stern's bosses exhibit no sense that they know whether their biggest star is apt to renew, retire, launch his own subscription service or do something else altogether.
Sirius XM Holdings CEO James E. Meyer, on Thursday's quarterly earnings call with analysts, said the company would "certainly hope" that Stern, 61, stays on board. He said the still edgy show "has never been bigger or better," and that he's left hanging on Stern's every word.
Like the rest of Stern's fans.
"You should assume we speak quite often, and stay tuned for updates," Meyer said of Stern's situation in the scripted portion of the presentation. "Of course, the best way to hear any news regarding his renewal is to (tune) in to Howard's show every morning. Heck, that's what I do."
It was a flat line-reading — especially when he got to "heck" — a reminder that performing before a microphone is not everyone's forte. But it was effective, pre-empting a deeper probing on the topic from the Wall Street reps. Not a "baba booey" to be heard.
Sirius XM at this moment is the beneficiary of the uptick in car sales, with buyers often driving off the lot as trial customers, then the option of paying for the service or forever staring at a button on their radio that does nothing.
The net effect of losing Stern and at least some of the paying listeners he brought may not be known.
One estimate has Stern's contract costing Sirius XM $80 million a year.
Detractors will point to his shrinking workload and the fact that, after 10 years, his impact on growing the service may have peaked.
But how many of the service's 29 million subscriptions, typically paying $9.99 per month or higher, are his? How important is he still in promoting the service?
How many other draws does Sirius XM have that can't be found somewhere else, and do their audiences consider them indispensable the way Stern die-hards do?
Ten years ago, Stern defected from traditional radio to give satellite radio not just a signature star and a badly needed tent pole but a whole carnival stretched out over two channels.
It didn't matter if only some of his listeners followed him to the pay service. The size of an audience, in media math, isn't nearly as important as how much revenue can be generated from it. Content is critical because subscription fees and subscriber dedication drive the model more than advertising.
But as technology has changed, it's not clear Stern needs the middleman. He could launch his own independent digital subscription service. All he needs is a URL and an app.
While Sirius XM needed expensive infrastructure to get to listeners, an economic burden it has had to absorb, many barriers have come down. Anyone can launch a podcast today. What few can do is launch a podcast people want to hear. Stern can.
At the same time, any number of other services — anything remotely connected to media — might benefit from welcoming Stern into their fold for all the reasons Sirius XM did.
He brings attention. He brings content. He brings paying customers.
If ESPN alumnus Bill Simmons is worth X millions to HBO for a multi-year, multi-platform deal, what multiple of X should Stern be able to command?
Stern just gave up a lucrative side gig as judge on NBC's "America's Got Talent." (Simon Cowell was named his replacement Thursday.) That prime-time showcase showed mainstream America just how shrewd his entertainment instincts are, and perhaps there's some way to parlay that into something.
That said, Stern also has been at this, in one form or another, for around 40 years. He will turn 62 in January. He has been making a lot of money for a decade now. He's married and has a good life.
If a David Letterman can walk away from the nightly program he once built almost his entire existence around, why can't Howard Stern?
Stern, on the air five years ago, warned everyone connected with his program to save their money because the ride might end after this contract.
We'll soon find out if Sirius XM was listening then.
We know its leaders are listening now.
Margin call: A new TV era began with singer Dorothy Collins' 2 1/2-minute performance on NBC's "The Jonathan Winters Show" 59 years ago Friday. It marked the first use of videotape on a national telecast and demonstrated that viewers would detect no difference. Within three years, NBC was taping more than 30 programs a week and CBS about 40.
