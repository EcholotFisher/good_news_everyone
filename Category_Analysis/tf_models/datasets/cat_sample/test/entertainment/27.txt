Demi Lovato suffered a make-up malfunction during a night out in New York City on Wednesday night, October 14. The "This Is Me" songstress was in the city to promote her new album " Confident ". Demi seemingly forgot to blend concealer under her eyes. When the "Heart Attack" singer stepped out to greet fans and take photos, bright flashes from the cameras exposed her finishing powder, giving her large, white, goggle-like circles around her face. Apart from her make-up malfunction , Demi still somehow managed to look amazing during the outing. The "Cool for the Summer" hitmaker wore a white cardigan paired with a white top and blue skinny jeans. She slicked her hair back and wore pink lipstick. She completed her look with a black tote bag and brown booties. Demi recently opened up about her decision to do a nude photo shoot for Vanity Fair. The "Let It Go" singer told E! News that she didn't have guts to do it six months ago . "I wouldn't have done that six months ago, because I didn't have the confidence that I do today," Demi confessed. "I went from hating every inch of my body to showing every inch of my body to the entire world and without touching up anything."
