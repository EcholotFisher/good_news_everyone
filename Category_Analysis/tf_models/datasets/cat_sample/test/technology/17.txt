Today, SteelSeries is introducing an exclusive affiliate awards program for the streaming community. The SteelSeries Affiliate Rewards Program is designed to offer brand advocates and prominent users of SteelSeries peripherals an opportunity to earn a commission on the products that they are already recommending to their community and fans. To kick-start the program, SteelSeries is offering all approved, affiliate program participants who sign-up within the next 30 days – by October 30th - an industry-high rate of 8% on all SteelSeries peripheral sales generated from their unique links and banners. In addition, the first 50 participants who sign-up and are approved, will also receive a SteelSeries Welcome Pack including a SteelSeries headset and swag.
“We have such a respect for streamers and the community. It’s not an easy thing to cultivate a following and be an engaging entertainer, especially for those who are looking to make it their full-time job. The streaming community has become an incredible group of SteelSeries brand advocates – far beyond those who are officially a part of our SteelSeries Stream Team. The new affiliate program is our way to award them for the work they are already doing – spreading the word about SteelSeries and our incredible products.” said Ehtisham Rabbani, SteelSeries CEO.
The SteelSeries Affiliate Program launches today for all streamers who reside in the U.S. and Canada. The program will extend globally later this season. To access the easy sign-up form and FAQ’s, please visit http://steelseries.com/affiliates .
