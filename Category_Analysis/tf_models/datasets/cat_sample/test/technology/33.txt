Announced today in conjunction with HubSpot Connect, Smartling's comprehensive Translation Connector brings the power of Smartling to the HubSpot platform. The Connector is easily installed with minimal developer involvement, and lets users translate content by any preferred translation vendor.

"Making the world of sales and marketing more inbound requires platforms that help deliver a more localized, in-language experience," said Brian Halligan, co-founder and CEO of HubSpot. "Our friends at Smartling share this vision, so we're pleased to partner with them as part of HubSpot Connect." 
Translation of HubSpot website pages and forms content can be requested directly from the Smartling Dashboard and removes the need to export or copy and paste content for translation. It provides powerful translation to HubSpot users, including: -- Automation - Changes to content are detected automatically, and translations are returned to HubSpot when complete. Users can focus on creating website pages and forms in other languages, and the platform will keep multilingual versions in sync. -- Efficiency - Translation Memory integration leverages previous translations to boost quality and speed, maintain consistency, all while reducing translation costs. -- High quality - Smartling's unique "in-context" translation interface provides translation resources with full visibility into design and layout during the entire translation process, reducing time-consuming edits and fixes to multilingual content -- Real-time visibility - Translation progress data is available directly in the HubSpot interface, eliminating the need to switch between multiple systems to monitor project activity. 
"Marketers using HubSpot can now deliver website pages and forms to more customers around the globe," said Andrew Saxe, senior director of product at Smartling. "We're very pleased to add HubSpot to our growing list of partners, as we continue to lead the market in integrating with the premier customer experience platforms."
