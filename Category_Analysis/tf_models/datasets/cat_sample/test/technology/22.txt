The Justice Department acknowledged on Wednesday that foreign governments can obtain customer data held in the U.S., as an agency lawyer pressed for access to emails stored by Microsoft Corp in Europe.
Control over data, regardless of its location, dictates whether a U.S. company must produce it to the government, Justice Department lawyer Justin Anderson told the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, where Microsoft is fighting a U.S. search warrant for customer emails stored in a data center in Ireland.
The outcome of the case could affect how privacy-conscious people outside the U.S. view American companies and their ability to safeguard customer data. A raft of companies have rallied to Microsoft's side, arguing in court briefs that their image abroad has already suffered from revelations about U.S. spying and the cooperation of telecom companies in intelligence programs.
The warrant in question was issued to Microsoft in connection with a drug-trafficking investigation the details of which remain secret. The government hasn't disclosed whether the email account holder is an U.S. citizen. "The warrant doesn't care where the records are," said Mr. Anderson.
By that logic, Judge Susan L. Carney said, a court in Germany could compel a German company to disclose customer email over which it has control, even if the emails were stored in the U.S.: "But it should be of no concern to us?" she asked. "This is the international norm," Mr. Anderson said.
Microsoft lawyer E. Joshua Rosenkranz, however, said compelling Microsoft to turn over the emails would impinge on Ireland's sovereignty and signal to other countries that data held in the U.S. was within their reach. "We are talking about a global free-for-all," he said.
The Irish government hasn't said whether it believes the search warrant is legal, and Mr. Rosenkranz couldn't point to a violation of European law when asked to by Judge Gerard E. Lynch.
In the past, U.S. courts have enforced subpoenas issued to banks for business records held abroad, even when foreign law prohibited it. The Second Circuit held in a 1984 ruling that control over records, not their location, is what counts in such cases.
Mr. Rosenkranz, in trying to distinguish his case, gave the example of a letter. The information on the outside of the envelope would be considered a business record. No court has ever held that a U.S. company must produce the content of communications--the letter on the inside--that is held abroad, he said.
Late in the hearing, Judge Lynch, who appeared to favor the government's arguments, noted the significance of the case. "The implications of what we do here are obviously broad."
A decision is expected in coming months.
