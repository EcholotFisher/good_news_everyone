The ride sharing service connects riders with drivers who often use their own car for a service that’s often cheaper than catching a taxi.
It said that 64 per cent of rides began or ended in a “transport desert” — areas more than 1km away from medium frequency public transport — and said a lot of users are effectively extending the public transport capabilities of their cities by using Uber in conjunction with trains, trams or buses.
The service still remains under a legal cloud in Australia however, with states still grappling over whether UberX should be deemed legal and laws updated to reflect our changing economy.
Uber Australia chief David Rorsheim said despite the recent success there was still a lot of room for the company to grow down under.
“We know only around one in ten Aussies have used Uber, and as we work with governments to introduce sensible, safety regulations for ridesharing, we expect the popularity of ridesharing to continue to grow,” he said via e-mail.
A recent Choice comparison found the UberX service was as safe as that offered by taxis, as UberX uses GPS tracking of all trips and because Uber already requires its drivers to undergo a police check, have a clean driving record and hold third party and third party property insurance, as well as providing insurance coverage itself for all UberX trips.
The federal Opposition announced today if it forms government it would aim for ‘tailored, light-touch’ rules for the sharing economy and fair taxation policies.
“There is huge economic and community potential in the emerging peer-to-peer market,” Labor leader Bill Shorten said.
“I want to see Australia embrace it, while ensuring we have the right rules in place to protect workers, consumers and the public good.”
