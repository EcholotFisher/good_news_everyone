If there is a law called the Affordable Care Act, and pharmaceuticals are critical to one’s care, then how is it the prices of drugs are so high? Could it be that these big drug/healthcare companies have simply bought and paid for the market conditions they desire from those who crafted the law? At this point there is simply no doubt that the Affordable Care Act was created to deceive by those who had no problem perpetrating the deception. The price of healthcare was never supposed to go down. What this law did was make big companies bigger. Look at the mergers that have occurred within the health insurance field. If you want higher quality and lower prices, you must have more competition, not less. Exactly none of the big health insurance companies ever wanted more competition.

Go slow on dropping ‘felon’ label I agree we need to help convicted convicts find good jobs after serving their time. This could be done through programs that creative incentives for businesses to hire ex-offenders. But to take the “felon tag” off? That could lead to a convicted felon applying for and getting a gun permit or concealed weapon permit. Maybe former Gov. George Ryan should clarify how his idea would work. Francis Lorke, Chicago Teachers union champions children A letter writer’s claim that kids are at the bottom of the Chicago Teachers Union education totem pole shows he learned nothing in the years he attended and taught in Chicago’s public schools. CTU is the only entity that fought for lower class sizes and even made that a strike issue. We fought for the rights of special education kids when CPS preferred to warehouse them. We were constantly told by top CPS administrators and negotiators, “You don’t bargain for kids.” Obviously, they didn’t either. And the first strike was in 1969, not 1970. Pamelyn Massarsky
