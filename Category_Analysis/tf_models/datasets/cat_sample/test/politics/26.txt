Politics | 15 October 2015 16:36 CET Listen to the voice of Ghanaians - Kufuor tells EC By Myjoyonline 
Former President John Agyekum Kufuor says the Electoral Commission must respect the voice of Ghanaians in the call for a new voters’ register. 
Speaking to leaders of pressure group, Let My Vote Count Alliance (LMVCA) who paid a courtesy call on him at his residence to seek his support for a new voters' register, Kufuor said: 
"I am with you entirely, completely that the Electoral Commission should not plead excuses like cleaning the voters' register.” 
The pro-NPP group has been agitating for a new register because they believe the current register is bloated with names of at least 76,000 foreigners. 
According to Kufuor, the Electoral Commission cannot be independent from accounting to the people of Ghana. “I have seen what faulty elections can do to otherwise peaceful people. So the Electoral Commission should listen,” he said. 
Since the NPP began this campaign for a new voters' register, some leading voices have weighed into the matter. The Ghana Catholics Bishop Conference says it favours a new register if evidence presented by the NPP is found to be true. 
Adding to the call, Former President Rawlings said "there is a lot of stress , there is a lot of nervousness in the air. It is going to be a test on all of Ghanaians and the only way we can really contain and prevent things from getting out of hands is to ensure that the electoral register is as credible as possible." 
A stateswoman, Dr. Joyce Aryee aslo believes, a new voters' register will clear the controversy and cure any credibility concerns.
