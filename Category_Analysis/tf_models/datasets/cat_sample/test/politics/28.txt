A teenager was murdered as a direct consequence of Kids Company’s sudden closure, the charity’s former chairman claimed yesterday. 
Appearing before MPs, Alan Yentob cited the death of a teenager five days after the charity closed in August, as well as stabbings and four suicide attempts, as the “consequence of the absence of a place for these children to go”. 
He defended a document sent by Kids Company to the Cabinet Office earlier this year which had warned that the young people the charity helped could “descend into savagery” if it closed, saying it “wasn’t a wild exaggeration”.
