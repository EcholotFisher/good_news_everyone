“’I yelled “please help me!” and they just spat at me,’ Benita told the Israeli Ynet news site of the surrounding Palestinian store owners, whom she said stood by as the Palestinian terrorist, 19-year-old Muhanad Halabi, stabbed her husband to death in an alleyway near Lion’s Gate in the Old City.” These are Obama’s peace partners, the people to whom Obama demands that Israel make concessions. This is pure savagery, and the world kowtows to it and cowers in fear before it.
“I yelled ‘please help me!’ and they just spat at me,” i24 News , October 4, 2015 (thanks to TheReligionofPeace.com ):
Adele Benita, one of the surviving victims of Saturday’s terror attack in Jerusalem’s Old City, gave a chilling account of how the stabbing attack, that killed her husband and another man who came to the family’s help, unfolded and how her cries for help were ignored as she herself was stabbed repeatedly.
“I yelled ‘please help me!’ and they just spat at me,” Benita told the Israeli Ynet news site of the surrounding Palestinian store owners, whom she said stood by as the Palestinian terrorist, 19-year-old Muhanad Halabi, stabbed her husband to death in an alleyway near Lion’s Gate in the Old City.
The family’s two-year-old son was also lightly injured in the attack after the attacker wrestled the weapon Aharon Benita was carrying from him and began shooting at a nearby group of tourists and police. The Benita’s infant girl miraculously remained unharmed.
Benita was taken in serious condition to Hadassah Hospital Ein Kerem in Jerusalem, where she underwent a life saving emergency surgery overnight Saturday.
Her husband died of his wounds at Shaare Zedek Hospital, also in Jerusalem, shortly after the attack.
“When we got back from the Western Wall, we felt that something wasn’t right,” she told Ynet news from her hospital bed Sunday.
“We started walking fast but the terrorist emerged from one of the stores and lunged at us and started stabbing my husband. My husband is a strong man and started fighting him, he punched him in the face. At that point, the terrorist started stabbing me. Then he went back to my husband and stabbed him again and again. I also fought him, I tried to take away the knife, but I failed,” she recounted.
“Nehemia Lavi, 41, and Aharon Benita, 22”
Benita said Palestinian youths who witnessed the attack laughed and cursed at her as she cried for help.
One of them slapped her while another laughed in her face and told her to “drop dead” when she told him she would give him a million shekels if he helped her get to safety with her two toddlers.
“They saw that we were with two baby carriages,” she said.
Nehemia Lavi, 41, an Old City resident who heard Benita’s cries for help, came to help and he too was stabbed and killed by the terrorist.
Lavi and Banita were laid to rest Sunday at the Givat Shaul cemetery in Jerusalem.
The terrorist was shot dead by security forces at the scene.
