The 1000kilometer class cruise missile, capabile of striking deep into the enemy territory, has been designed and developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation at it's aeronautics R&D laboratory ADE (Aeronautical Development Establishment) based in Bengaluru, they said.
The maiden test flight of Nirbhay on March 12, 2013 also had to be terminated midway for safety reasons due to malfunction of a component. However, the second launch on October 17, 2014 was fully successful. Both the trials were conducted from this base.
