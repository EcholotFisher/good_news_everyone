According to a survey from Match, a quarter of singles would sign up with a personal trainer who they think has sex appeal and more than half of singles would be willing to turn a sweaty strength training session into a steamy afternoon rendezvous.
And while a ripped bod can get anyone's heart pounding, a healthy lifestyle and being passionate about helping others achieve their fitness goals makes these trainers beautiful inside and out. Whether you're looking for a volunteer firefighter with a heart of gold, a globe-trotting fitness model who dives with sharks or a parkour expert straight out of a James Bond film, Match has gathered the sexiest, healthiest and most eye-catching trainers, and now, we're asking you to help us decide: Who's really the hottest one of all?
Starting today, Match will donate $1 to the American Heart Association to help fight heart disease for every unique profile view of the 11 Hottest Trainers on the site. The trainer with the most profile views through Oct. 18 will receive the ultimate fitness prize package including a $5,000 cash prize to help further his or her career in fitness, an opportunity to work out with top celebrity trainer, Jeanette Jenkins , and the chance to be a featured expert on AHA's digital properties.
