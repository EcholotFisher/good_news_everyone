New Zealand First extends our support to the All Blacks for the Rugby World Cup quarter-final match against France. 
"We are one hundred per cent behind the All Blacks as they head into the quarter finals this Sunday," says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Sport and Recreation Clayton Mitchell. 
"I am fully confident this quarter-final will not be a repeat of 2007 when the All Blacks were defeated. 
"It is disappointing that Kiwis have not been able to watch the World Cup games live and free to air. Not everyone has the spare money for pay TV. 
"While the quarter-final with be live and free to air, New Zealand First will continue to fight for an equal footing with our Australian and UK friends who under the law are guaranteed free and live coverage of listed events. Our Bill, Broadcasting (Games of National Significance) Amendment Bill, is awaiting selection from the members’ ballot. 
"I have made a stand and I will not shave until the All Blacks bring the World Cup home or the tournament is over. I’m confident I won’t be shaving anytime soon."
