Republican Student Loan Bill Is A Handout To The Loan Industry User Name Current Events Current Events Forum - Latest political news and events 8 Thanks Quote: . . . Despite the framing of the legislation as beneficial to students, its really the private market that has the most to gain from this bill. This bill would also provide a loan guarantee for refinanced loans. To better understand why Republican lawmakers are pushing for this bill, its important to remember that in 2010, The Affordable Care Act contained a reconciliation bill that meant all student loans would originate with the federal government compared to the old system, when 55 percent of those loans originated with banks. The federal government used to pay the banks more than the cost of the loans, which meant the change would actually save taxpayer money. When the bank-based student loan system ended in 2010, most conservatives opposed efforts to change the system, even though it would cost far less if the government took on those responsibilities. Several institutions that benefitted from the old bank-based system were allowed to become student loan servicers after the change, but this bill would allow them a way back into issuing loans. . . . Well, when your party allows itself to be bribed by Wall Street, these are the anti-American family bills you give the nation.
