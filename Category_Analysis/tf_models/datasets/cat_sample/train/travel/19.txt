August 21, 2015 Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park 
Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London will bring holiday cheer to its guests through a partnership with its neighbor department store Harrods. 
During the Christmas season, Mandarin Oriental will have placement in Harrods’ window display, while the hotel will serve a taste of Harrods with a themed afternoon tea. Holidays are often a time of camaraderie between luxury establishments, giving them more of an opportunity to make a magical and memorable experience for consumers. 
Making memories At Christmastime, Harrods will makeover the Mandarin Oriental’s public spaces, including the lobby and the Rosebery, using a gold and red color scheme. This display, debuting Nov. 27, will center on a Christmas tree in the lobby. 
Between Nov. 23 and Dec. 30, guests can book “A Very Harrods Christmas” room package, which includes a one-night stay for two adults and two children. During their time at the hotel, they will be given a Christmas welcome gift, including the Harrods 2015 Teddy Bear, and also be taken on a VIP appointment with Harrods’ gift bureau to get present shopping assistance.

Hotels and retailers both benefit from tourism, something celebrated in collaborative campaigns. French department store chain Printemps paid homage to Parisian hotels with an in-store campaign that paired high fashion with hospitality. “Printemps Palace” centered on a series of window displays featuring editorial fashion imagery captured within four local properties. This campaign enabled Printemps to celebrate its connection with other Parisian landmarks and tourist destinations ( see story ).
