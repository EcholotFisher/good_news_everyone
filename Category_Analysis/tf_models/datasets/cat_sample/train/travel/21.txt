MIAMI, FL - Carnival Cruise Line has signed a multi-year agreement with the New Orleans Saints that includes in-stadium promotions, community partnerships, onboard game-day festivities, social media activities and advertising opportunities. 
As the Official Cruise Line of the New Orleans Saints, Carnival will bring even more fun to the Big Easy with a variety of in-game activities and promotions at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, including the "Helmet Shuffle" contest that awards one lucky fan a free cruise during each home game. Additionally, stand-alone ads will be positioned throughout the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, while Carnival messaging will be featured on the team's web site. 
Guests on board Carnival's New Orleans-based ships can also enjoy the new Saints Sailgate Sailaways, football-themed deck parties that will include food and drink specials, games, prizes, a DJ, dancing and more. 
Saints fans will also have a chance to win a number of fantastic prizes, including autographed jerseys, footballs and helmets and free Caribbean cruises departing from New Orleans. 
Carnival is also teaming up with the Saints to support the team's Read and Rise program that promotes children's literacy in and around the New Orleans area. 
"Carnival has been a part of the New Orleans community for more than 20 years and this partnership with the Saints offers fans a variety of opportunities to engage with the team and, just like on board our ships, provides an environment that creates a lifetime of wonderful memories," said Christine Duffy, Carnival's president. 
"Both Carnival Cruise Line and the New Orleans Saints are committed members of the greater New Orleans community who share similar objectives in regards to enhancing the combined economic impact of our partnering brands on the city and region," said Saints Owner Tom Benson. "We are thrilled to join with Carnival as they add another element of excitement to our game-day experience, while enhancing the appeal of the tourism industry for our region."
