Weekend fun or school holiday treat? Gallery Mess in London gets creative with Origamitea. By Valentina Mariani 
Summer is starting and school holidays are fast approaching, so why not plan ahead and arrange a visit to Gallery Mess with the kids for Origamitea. 
Designed to entertain and encourage creativity alongside the classic afternoon tradition, Origamitea will provide children the chance to create ‘Freddie the fox’ and friends through the Japanese art of folding paper – Origami. 
Alongside the selection of Origami animals children and adults alike can enjoy a traditional afternoon tea offering of British sandwiches, warm scones with clotted cream, macaroons and delicate cakes. To add to this, kids can enjoy a babyccino, while adults can sip on an array of fine teas or one of Gallery Mess’ fabulous cocktails, or a flute of bubbles for an additional £8.25. 
Designed by the ever-innovative restaurant operator “rhubarb” the Origamitea is available daily, priced at £7.50pp and the adults Afternoon Tea is priced at only £15.50pp/£29.50 for two. 
Located next to the Saatchi Gallery, Gallery Mess provides an excellent space to relax after an educational trip around the contemporary gallery next door, or as a pit stop on your way to another adventure.
