Dusit deepens Philippine presence with Cebu stake Bangkok, August 4, 2015 
DUSIT International will be staking out a wider presence in Asia with its plans to expand to the Philippine island of Cebu by 2018. 

Representatives from Dusit International and Cebu-based developer Grand Land, Inc (GLI) signed an agreement to develop a Dusit Princess hotel in Cebu during a recent ceremony held at the City Sports Club in Cebu Business Park. 

The 295-key property, located north of Metro Cebu in the North Reclamation area, will be part of a mixed-use development containing retails outlets, offices and apartments. Facilities within the hotel include restaurants, meeting rooms, a gym and swimming pools. 

Ryan Bernard Go, president of GLI, expressed confidence that the construction of the project will begin this year. 

Go also revealed in a press statement that the firm is venturing into the hotel-apartment business because it sees the need for Cebu tourism to have more branded hotels. 

“We want to expand the tourism industry so we hope to develop hotels and resorts, north or south of Cebu. The partnership with Dusit International may extend to more GLI hotel projects. For this project, there will be units in the integrated development to be sold to individual investors while office spaces will be made available for purchase,” Go disclosed.
