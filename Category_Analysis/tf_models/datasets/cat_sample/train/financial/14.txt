Kenya Airways Resumes Bangui Flights Tagged: Kenya Airways will next month resume flights to Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic. The flights were suspended in March 2013, following a civil unrest in the country. Bangui, which is the largest city in Central African Republic is expected to give the Kenyan national carrier access to more customers. Before the flights were called off, Kenya Airways operated two weekly flights to the city, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. "Passengers will benefit from our new flights between Bangui and Doula. We will be watching the market closely with a view to adding frequencies in the near future," said KQ chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze said on Wednesday. Operations will start with two frequencies per week, directly from Nairobi and from Bangui onwards to Douala in Cameroon. Flights are operated in a Boeing 737-800. REGIONAL MARKET The route enables investors dealing in diamonds, coffee, cotton and timber access to the regional market as well as Europe. Bangui is rich in diamonds and has over four million people who are expected to frequently travel to promising investment hubs including Kenya. KQ applies the 'fifth freedom' between M'Poko International Airport in Bangui and the Douala International Airport in Cameroon. This allows it to carry revenue traffic between the foreign countries connecting flights through Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. 'Fifth freedom' are a set of commercial aviation rights granting a country's airline the privilege to enter and land in another country's airspace. The route is expected to offer easier connectivity for the importers of food and textiles from major suppliers in France, United States of America, Cote d'Ivoire, Germany and Japan. Kenya
