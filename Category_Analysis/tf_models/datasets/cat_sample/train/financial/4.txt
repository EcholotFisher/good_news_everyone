Michael del Castillo Jonathan Jaglom, Makerbot’s new CEO, speaks at Internet Week New York, May 18, 2015. In the three months since Jonathan Jaglom stepped into the CEO role at Makerbot — the company's fourth leader in the past two years — he's been a busy guy, according to an interesting rundown offered by Technical.ly . Of the milestones attributed to Jaglom, the former general manager of Stratasys’ Asia Pacific and Japan division, three stand out as part of a strategy that appears to be aimed at turning Brooklyn’s 3D-printing sweetheart into a global brand before the competition elbows them out: Jaglom set up Makerbot APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan) at parent-company Stratasys (Nasdaq: SSYS) Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. Jaglom’s predecessor, Jenny Lawton , now at littleBits , had hoped to manage the expansion directly from Brooklyn, according to the report. To ease concerns over the tumultuous changes in leadership, Jaglom established a “creative council” of about 50 employees from across the company to help define corporate values. Jaglom is embarked on a 22 state “listening tour” to engage in a dialogue with customers, partners, and schools. Related Content
