NEW YORK, Oct. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Location-focused video advertising platform, Yashi, today announced the launch of Yashi Open. This service allows advertisers and publishers to bring their own directly purchased or owned digital video inventory and use Yashi's award winning platform to plan, optimize, and measure their media programs . Open is offered as a standalone service or in tandem with the Yashi Demand Side Platform. Yashi began delivering this service in beta in Q2 to several advertisers and publishers.
