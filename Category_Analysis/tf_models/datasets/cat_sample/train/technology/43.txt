Cyrus not interested in joining Taylor Swift squad 
Technology Industry News.Net (IANS) : Tuesday 1st September, 2015 
Pop star Miley Cyrus says she is not interested in making a squad like singer Taylor Swift. 
While Swift tends to gather "musicians, actresses, models, entrepreneurs," the "Wrecking ball" hitmaker admitted that she's not interested in such a group. 
"I'm not trying to be in the squad," Cyrus was quoted as saying by The New York Times, reports aceshowbiz.com. 
She went on saying that she preferred being surrounded by non-celebrity friends. 
"None of my friends are famous and not because of any other reason than I just like real people who are living real lives, because I'm inspired by them," she added. 
Cyrus has also tried to take control of her own celebrity narrative, delivering pictures of herself straight to her fans via social media. 
"I put naked pictures on my Instagram - I don't care. It's not interesting anymore to see me like that," she added. 
Cyrus also admitted it would be hard for her to fit again into mainstream society. 
"I don't think I'll grow that way," Cyrus said. "It seems like it would be backwards." More Technology Industry News
