Charles Bukowski was never really a billboard for good health. But it was not just the long nights spent drinking in rundown bars that were to blame. It was work.
In 1969, at the age of 49, he could finally stop working by the hour. In a letter to his publisher John Martin, who, by offering a monthly salary of $100, had made this transition possible, Bukowski described the terrible blow work had dealt him: “The color leaves the eye. The voice becomes ugly. And the body. The hair. The fingernails. The shoes.”
Bukowski wondered why anyone would agree to such humiliations, and was not alone in his skepticism. In his time, working 9-to-5 was a symbol for the inauthentic life, a constant and pointless shuttling between the office and the television set.
But Bukowski’s main concern was not that what the 9-to-5 workday symbolized, but that it always turned into something else. “They call it ‘9 to 5,’” he wrote in the letter to his publisher, already predicting that there would be worse things than an eight-hour workday. “It's never 9 to 5, there's no free lunch break at those places, in fact, at many of them in order to keep your job you don't take lunch. Then there's overtime and the books never seem to get the overtime right and if you complain about that, there's another sucker to take your place.”
