Rumors about the Galaxy S7 have been circulating since Samsung’s current smartphone hit stores – if not earlier – and while most have been seemingly based on sheer conjecture or else not worth repeating, the latest offerings seem a bit more believable. Korean news outlet ETNews is reporting that the new super smartphone will make its official debut in January – possibly the 19th – and that there should be both a “premium” and a “sub-premium” variant.
SamMobile had previously reported that this dual dichotomy is going to be a follow-up to the S6 and S6 Edge; the SM-G930 being the standard-affair offering, and the SM-G935 featuring the OEM’s iconic curved display.
Also mentioned in today’s rumor report is a claim that “ Project Lucky ” will use an ePoP chip to integrate all the necessary sensor components on a single die, an engineering strategy employed by the S6 to help improve efficiency.
Spec-wise, the details are somewhat confusing. There may be several different processor variants depending on the market the S7 is sold in, and the flagship smartphone may use a pressure-sensitive display technology similar to what Apple has started marketing. Also slated are USB Type-C support and even a dual-camera arrangement with a brand new 20-megapixel primary sensor.
As with all rumors, this piece should not be considered as factual until Samsung so speaketh. The specs could change, and the product launch could even be held later than the typical MWC-debut. Just a few weeks back, some were claiming the S7 would be announced in December, for reference. Still, given the strategic decision to launch the Galaxy Note 5 (and S6 Edge+ ) earlier than usual, anything is possible.
