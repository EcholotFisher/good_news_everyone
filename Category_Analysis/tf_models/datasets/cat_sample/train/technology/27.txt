Twitter's interim CEO Jack Dorsey signaled at the company’s July 28 earnings call that he wasn’t just going to mark time until a permanent chief exec showed up. Calling Twitter’s recent performance “unacceptable,” he was deeply critical of the company, and went on to lay out an ambitious turnaround process — one that would surely take longer than Twitter’s CEO search. But for Dorsey, getting the CEO title is only the first step. The company had 302 million monthly active and registered users at the end of June, which is just 2 million more than during the preceding quarter, and a far cry from Facebook’s 1.49 billion monthly active users. What’s worse, Twitter’s growth in the U.S. has completely flatlined, with 65 million monthly actives.
