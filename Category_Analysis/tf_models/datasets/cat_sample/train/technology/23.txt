Texas Instruments Inc. on Wednesday reported stronger-than-expected profit and revenue for its third quarter and offered upbeat guidance for its current quarter.
Shares of the Dallas-based company jumped 8.6% in after-hours trading.
Texas Instruments, which initially focused on reflection seismography for the oil industry, has been moving away from digital chips to focus on analog chips, which often command lower prices but can be produced with older equipment at a high profit. TI has struggled recently with lackluster demand for personal electronics, particularly PCs, and communications equipment.
In the latest quarter, sales in both the analog segment and the embedded processing segment, which includes processors and microcontrollers, grew 2%.
Overall, TI reported a profit of $798 million, down from $826 million a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings were flat at 76 cents on fewer shares outstanding.
Revenue ticked down 2.1% to $3.43 billion.
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast 68 cents a share in earnings on $3.28 billion in revenue.
For the current quarter, TI said it expects earnings of 64 cents to 74 cents a share on $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast 62 cents a share in earnings and $3.12 billion in revenue for the period.
