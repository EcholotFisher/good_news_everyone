Washington, July 22 (ANI): Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that there are over 8,500 third-party Apple Watch apps available as per revenue calls in quarter three. According to The Verge, Apple previously said the Watch had launched with about 3,000 compatible apps. That's about 5,500 new apps in the three months since the launch. That 8,500 figure also, however, represents less than one percent of the over 1.5 million iPhone apps now in the App Store, Cook said Twitter, Line, and WeChat are some of the most-used Apple Watch apps, and predicted that all of this might change when WatchOS 2, which enables native apps, is released later this year.
