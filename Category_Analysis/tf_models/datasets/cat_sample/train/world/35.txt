Plague samples possibly mislabeled at US military lab Posted on 11 September 2015 - 01:23pm Print 
WASHINGTON : US inspectors carrying out a review at a Defence Department laboratory found plague samples that may have been mislabeled, the Pentagon confirmed Thursday. 
The finding, first reported in USA Today , is the latest development in a scandal that began in May when the military revealed it had accidentally sent out live anthrax samples from the Dugway Proving Ground research center in the Utah desert. 
As a result, officials launched a department-wide review of how the military's secure labs handle biological agents. 
Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said inspectors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had found a plague sample at the Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological Center in Maryland last month. 
But instead of the sample being kept in a special containment area it was discovered in a freezer just outside. 
"Additional testing is being conducted to try and verify once and for all whether or not it was labeled correctly and placed in the right location," Cook said. 
He also said there were concerns over the handling of equine encephalitis samples. 
Plague is a rare and dangerous disease that can be fatal if left untreated. 
Cook said health officials were confident there was no risk to workers or the general public. 
Live anthrax spores had been inadvertently shipped from Dugway to all 50 states and nine foreign countries during a decade-long program to provide deactivated samples of the deadly pathogen to private and military labs for research and testing. 
On September 3, the military ordered a production freeze and safety review at all Defense Department labs that handle biological agents and toxins, including anthrax. 
Cook said results of a procedural review are expected in October. â€“ AFP Opinion
