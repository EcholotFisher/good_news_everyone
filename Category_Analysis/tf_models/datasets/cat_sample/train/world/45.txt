Cardale Jones has not looked sharp in the last two games for top-ranked Ohio State, but coach Urban Meyer said Wednesday that he's not changing quarterbacks this week.
Jones remains the starter and J.T. Barrett the No. 2 quarterback for the Buckeyes' final nonconference game on Saturday against Western Michigan in Ohio Stadium.
Last week in a 20-13 victory over Northern Illinois, Ohio State coaches turned to Barrett in the second quarter after Jones threw two interceptions and completed just 4 of 9 passes for 36 yards.
With Barrett behind center, he fired a touchdown pass before the first half ended, but the offense also sputtered in the second half.
"The other guy has to pass him, and that hasn't happened," Meyer said after Wednesday's practice.
"(Jones) was the quarterback of the team when we finished the season last year. He was the quarterback in the spring. He was the quarterback at the end of fall practice. He has not been beat out. It's not him. The whole offense is in a funk."
Jones has started all three games so far this season and has thrown for 334 yards and two touchdowns with three interceptions. The redshirt junior has yet to approach the efficiency he displayed in leading the Buckeyes to wins in the Big Ten championship and College Football Playoff games last year.
Ohio State's offense is also struggling to develop consistency. The Buckeyes are averaging 33.3 points per game this season, more than 10 points fewer than in 2014.
