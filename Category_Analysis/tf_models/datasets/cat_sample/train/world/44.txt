A search operation is organised from Tofino, British Columbia, after a whale-watching boat with 27 people on board sank off Vancouver Island. Canadian military aircraft were scouring the area where the vessel – the 65ft-long (20m) Leviathan II – sent a distress signal around 5pm local time. A number of people have died and others were missing
