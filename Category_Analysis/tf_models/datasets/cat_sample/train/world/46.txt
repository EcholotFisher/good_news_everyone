BEIJING (AP) â€” China has handed over the remains of what are believed to be three American fliers killed in a plane crash in Tibet during World War II.
The ceremony in the city of Chengdu is a reminder of the strong cooperation between the U.S. and China's then-Nationalist Party government in the struggle against Japan.
The 28 human bones were found in and around the wreck of a C-87 transport plane that crashed in 1943 while flying over the Himalayas between China and India. They are believed to be from members of the U.S. military.
In more recent years, Beijing's current communist government and Washington have been viewed as locked in a struggle for military supremacy in Asia.
Despite that, exchanges between their militaries have grown in both scale and depth.
