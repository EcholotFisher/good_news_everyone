According to a news release from the NOPD, Officer Robert Hurst was placed on emergency suspension without pay after the arrest. 
Officials said Hurst was off duty at home when he got into an argument with his girlfriend. The victim told police that the argument turned physical and Hurst “began to push and choke her and pull her hair.” 
St. Bernard Parish sheriff’s deputies responded to the Chalmette home and arrested Hurst on a charge of simple battery. 
Hurst's department-issued property, including his firearm, were confiscated when he was placed on suspension. 
Hurst is a 11-year veteran of the NOPD and was most recently assigned to the NOPD Fifth District. 
Editor's Note: The NOPD initially stated Hurst was a 15-year veteran. They corrected Hurst's time with the NOPD to 11 years in a followup email.
