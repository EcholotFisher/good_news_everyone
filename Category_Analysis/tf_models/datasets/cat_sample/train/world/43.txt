JOLIET, Ill. -- The last person convicted in the deaths of two Joliet men who were lured to a house on promises of a good time has been sentenced.
Illinois law required a life sentence for Adam Landerman after he was found guilty in June of the strangulation deaths of Eric Glover and Terrance Rankins, both 22. Will County Circuit Judge Amy Bertani-Tomczak on Friday handed down the sentence.
Glover and Rankins were lured to a Joliet house, where they expected to party with Alisa Massaro, Bethany McKee, Joshua Miner and Landerman. Instead, Miner strangled Rankins while Landerman strangled Glover.
McKee and Miner were found guilty by Judge Gerald Kinney in trials last year and sentenced to life imprisonment. Massaro pleaded guilty to robbery and concealing a homicide charges in exchange for a 10-year sentence and testimony against the others.
