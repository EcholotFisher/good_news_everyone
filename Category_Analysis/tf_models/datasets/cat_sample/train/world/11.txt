POPE Francis was reduced to a fit of laughter when he came across a baby dressed in the same clothes as him on the penultimate day of his US tour. 
Francis concluded his six-day visit to America in Philadelphia, where thousands gathered to greet him as he traveled in his 'Popemobile' through the city. 
Daniel and Dana Madden paid homage to the 78-year-old's first official visit to the US by dressing their daughter Quinn in a traditional white cassock complete with a ceremonial headdress known as a 'mitre' for Francis's papal parade on Saturday.

The Pontiff quickly spotted the couple holding Quinn up and convulsed with laughter as he beckoned security guards to pass her over. 
He could be seen whispering to a security guard as he held the baby before passing it back over to Ms Madden. 
Mr Madden told 6abc Action News: "He [Francis] told his security guard to tell us that we have a great sense of humour." 
The Pope arrived in Washington on Tuesday after a flight from Cuba, where he met with President Obama and delivered an address in front of Congress.
