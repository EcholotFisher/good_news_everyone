Authorities say three police officers have been killed after some 50 armed men attacked a police station near Burkina Faso's border with Mali. 
The attack took place early Friday in Samoroguan, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the border, according to a statement. 
Resident Appolinaire Kam said two civilians were seriously injured in the attack. 
Burkina Faso has largely been spared the attacks by Islamic extremists suffered by its neighbors Mali and Niger, but Friday's attack marks the second time in a month that a police station has been targeted by gunmen. 
One officer was killed a month ago in the country's north by assailants who said they wanted to kill Christians.
