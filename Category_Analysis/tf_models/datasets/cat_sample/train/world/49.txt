Croatian police say more than 90,000 migrants have passed through the country and moved on toward Western Europe in little more than two weeks.
Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said Thursday that only five people remain in one of the two main refugee camps in Croatia, while the rest have already moved on to Hungary.
Migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia want to reach the rich countries of Western Europe such as Germany and Sweden.
Croatia became a transit country for migrants in mid-September after Hungary closed its border with Serbia to stop the flow coming that way.
The migrant tide is not expected to slow amid fears of worsening weather conditions as winter approaches.
