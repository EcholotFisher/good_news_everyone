A YOUNG couple sharing their engagement news on Facebook have also accidentally announced they are expecting a baby. 
The Daily Mail reports bride-to-be Miranda Levy shared this picture on Facebook writing: "I am truly blessed today as the love of my life has asked me to marry him", not realising the pregnancy test in the photo's lower left-hand corner. 
But friends of the pair were quick to notice it asking: "What, so you're pregnant too?" 
"Wait... wtf [sic] are you guys talking about? Why would you think that?" Ms Levy wrote back. 
A minute later the penny dropped. 
"Oh," she wrote in a subsequent post. 
Soon after Ms Levy added another comment on her timeline, saying: "Hey guys, we're having a baby too." announcement
