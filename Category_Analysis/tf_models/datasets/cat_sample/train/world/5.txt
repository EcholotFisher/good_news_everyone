RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) â€” Prince Abdullah Al Saud has been appointed by Saudi King Salman as the new Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States, according to the Saudi Embassy in Washington DC.
The prince, whose full name is Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud, has not directly served in a senior government post before. Between 2000 and 2004, he headed the Saudi Arabia General Investment Authority, which seeks to promote investment in the kingdom. In that capacity he was ranked a minister.
The new ambassador is not seen as part of the inner circle of the royal family and is not a direct grandson of Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdulaziz.
His predecessor in Washington was Adel al-Jubeir, who was promoted to foreign minister in April.
Saudi-U.S. relations have cooled slightly since Washington pursued a nuclear accord with Iran that Riyadh strongly opposes.
