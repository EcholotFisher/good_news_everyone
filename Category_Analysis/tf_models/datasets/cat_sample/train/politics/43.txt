The girls, who were earlier seen in Raanjhanaa (2013), would often huddle and share a good laugh while filming PRDP . Swara says, "Soorajji would fall prey to our mischief. Even Salman (Khan) would wonder what we were up to." Recalling one such incident, she says, "The entire cast was waiting for the shot. It was taking long, so Sonam and I started watching some item numbers on her phone when Sooraj sir caught us. He was angry. But before he could shout, we made a cute face. He cooled down and told us to get back into the mood of the film."
