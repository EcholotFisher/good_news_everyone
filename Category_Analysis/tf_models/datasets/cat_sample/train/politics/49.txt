BILL MINOR: GOP control roiled in state by disruptions The trouble with Republicans running the show in the Mississippi Legislature and the U.S. House is that they are not dedicated to making government work. They are dedicated to crippling government so that it doesn’t work. Another word for that is anarchy. Start with Mississippi. A perfect example is a top issue right now: adopting Initiative 42, a constitutional amendment mandating full funding of the state’s 18 year old public education budget formula. The formula is aimed at adequately funding schools in poorer districts. That issue had hauled a dozen states into court in the late 1980s and 1990s and ordered them to enact equity funding school laws. In some instances, judges of the highest state courts wrote detailed plans that must be followed. Daily Journal Posted October 9, 2015 - 5:15 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
