DENVER â€” A driver who struck and seriously injured a Denver police officer during a protest over police killings has pleaded guilty to two felony charges. 
The Denver Post reports ( http://goo.gl/d94keh ) 42-year-old Christopher Booker pleaded guilty Thursday to vehicular assault and attempting to influence a public servant. He's scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 4. 
Booker apparently suffered a seizure Dec. 3 when he struck John Adsit and other officers monitoring a protest of hundreds of high school students. 
Police say Booker knew his medical condition made him a danger on the road. He did not disclose his conditions when applying for multiple driver's licenses between 2006 and 2015. 
Adsit underwent 11 surgeries to repair crushed ribs, a punctured lung, a severed artery in his leg, a broken femur and a cracked pelvis.
