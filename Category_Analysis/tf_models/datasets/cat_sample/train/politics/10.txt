Communications Minister Amy Adams and MÄori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell have announced eight appointees to the MÄori ICT Development Fund Expert Advisory Group. 
In Budget 2014, the Government allocated $30 million for a MÄori ICT Development Fund to support MÄori economic development and support access to MÄori language and culture through digital literacy initiatives. 
The group will provide advice about how the fund will work including its objectives and the design of an operational framework. It will also make recommendations to the Ministers’ about how the grant should be spent. 
"It has important work to do to ensure the fund is used to its full potential and the new members bring a broad cross-section of skills and experience to the group", says Mr Flavell. 
The MÄori ICT Development Fund Expert Advisory Group will look to confirm the operational framework of the fund and investment priorities later this year. 
"There are a wide range of initiatives that this fund could support, such as projects to improve digital literacy, scholarships to encourage Maori to study ICT, or programmes aimed at increasing the use of ICT by Maori businesses, so we want to see the fund in operation as soon as practicably possible" says Ms Adams. 
Each member has been appointed for a term of three years.
