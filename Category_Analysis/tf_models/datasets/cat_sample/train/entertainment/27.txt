Nicholas Brandon Diehl, 26, was arrested Sunday, Oct. 4, after Murrieta police say he threatened officers via a post on the social-media site.
The incident began Sunday morning when officers arrested Diehl on suspicion of domestic disturbance in the 39000 block of Columbia Union Drive in Murrieta, about a mile west of Murrieta Hot Springs Road and Interstate 215, according to a Murrieta news release.
He was then released from the Southwest Detention Center. Murrieta police then say he wrote in a Facebook post that he would shoot the officers who arrested him. Detectives examined the post and determined it was a criminal act.
At 6:04 p.m., Diehl was arrested near his home on suspicion of criminal threats in lieu of $20,000 bail, the news release and booking logs show.
He was released the next day.
