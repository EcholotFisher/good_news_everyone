InventHelp, a Pittsburgh-based inventor service company, is submitting the BOWFORCE to companies for their review.
PITTSBURGH, PA (PRWEB) October 18, 2015
"Aspiring violinists can easily become discouraged if they do not enjoy practicing their instruments," said an inventor from Butler, Ohio. "To help students learn to play more easily, I developed this improved bow guide that bestows a variety of benefits."
She created a prototype for the patent-pending BOWFORCE to keep the bow perpendicular to the strings while playing. This ensures that the individual is using proper technique. It enables the player to produce clean, clear tones. This makes the violin sound more pleasing, which encourages the individual to play more frequently. Additionally, the accessory will not scratch or mar the body of the instrument.
The original design was submitted to the Telemarketing office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
