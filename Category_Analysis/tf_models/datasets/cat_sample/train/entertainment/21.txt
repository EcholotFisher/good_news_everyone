“I DIDN’T realise Seth Rogen was so sensitive?” 
That’s what Stav Davidson from Brisbane’s HIT 105 breakfast show had to say after he and co-host Abby Coleman accidentally started a feud with the Hollywood star on Twitter this morning. 
The brouhaha started when the radio duo tagged Seth Rogen in a tweet as they solicited for people to call in for a talk topic. 
“Who has a celebrity lookalike & are you unhappy about it? Adrian our audio guy got told he looks like @Sethrogen on the weekend!” 
The hosts probably weren’t expecting the Knocked Up star to see the tweet, let alone respond to it, but that's exactly what happened. 
“ @StavAndAbby that hurts my feelings!” wrote Rogen who has 3.31 million Twitter followers. 
The HIT 105 team tried to capitalise on the reply and asked the 33-year-old actor if he’d like to “come on our show and talk about it in the next five minutes”. 
But Rogen clearly wasn’t in a playful mood. 
“@StavAndAbby why the fu*k would I do that after you insulted me?” he wrote. 
Speaking to news.com.au, Abby Coleman said they didn’t mean to offend Rogen. 
“I think it’s a compliment — I think Seth Rogen’s cute,” she said. 
But Stav was less ... complimentary. 
“I didn’t realise Seth Rogen was so sensitive?” he said. 
“At least no one says they look like him in The Green Hornet … cos no one saw that piece of sh*t”. 
Oh, and in case you’re wondering, here’s what Adrian the audio guy actually looks like: That’s the real Seth Rogen on the left and lookalike Adrian on the right. Source: Supplied
