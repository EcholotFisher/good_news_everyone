TRAVIS Barker and Rita Ora have reportedly split. 
The Blink 182 drummer enjoyed a brief romance with the 'I Will Never Let You Down' singer after meeting for the first time at the Power 106 All-Star Game in Los Angeles on September 20 but the duo are believed to have called time on their relationship already. 
According to the Daily Mirror, Travis said: "I don't have that longing to be in a relationship 24/7." 
The swift demise of their relationship comes as a surprise after Travis previously gushed about Rita. 
Explaining how they met, he said: "I performed with Tyga and Kid Ink. We had just met through passing. We have a mutual friend named Willie T. I had walked up and he was like, 'Yo, take a picture with Rita.' And I was like, 'OK.' 
"We just took a photo together, but obviously she's stunning and she's awesome." 
The 39-year-old rocker admitted he and Rita, 24 - who wore a black and white cheerleader uniform at the event - only spoke briefly that night, though he was able to introduce his 11-year-old son Landon to her and she left a lasting impression. 
He added: "Of course Rita Ora was like the only hot cheerleader at the whole spot, so you couldn't help but notice her." bang showbiz
