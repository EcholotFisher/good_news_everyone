Flavor Flav gets February trial date in traffic case 3:37 a.m. Friday, Oct. 16, 2015 | Filed in: Celebrity news Comments 0 ï»¿ 
The trial for entertainer Flavor Flav has been postponed until Feb. 8 for misdemeanor driving under the influence, speeding and cocaine charges stemming from a vehicle stop last May in Las Vegas. 
Prosecutors and defense attorney Dayvid Figler said the new date allows time to try to resolve the case against the 56-year-old rapper and reality television star, whose real name is William Drayton Jr. 
The Nevada Highway Patrol says the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee was clocked going 87 mph in a 65-mph zone. 
Drayton settled criminal charges this week in New York's Nassau County stemming from a traffic stop while racing to his mother's funeral on Long Island. 
He pleaded guilty Tuesday to an unlicensed driver charge, fined about $3,600 and sentenced to time already served.
