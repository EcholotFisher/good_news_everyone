STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) - Penn State University is bringing alumnus Keegan-Michael Key to serve as the school's homecoming grand marshal this week. 
The Centre Daily Times reports (http://bit.ly/1jeDIc5 ) the 44-year-old actor says he hopes to give back to the university where he received his master of fine arts degree in 1996. 
Key says he was surprised when he was asked to be the grand marshal, citing other alumni he says were more deserving. 
Key lives in Los Angeles and is known for being a part of the Comedy Central TV show "Key & Peele." 
He will lead the homecoming parade Friday and then attend the football game against Indiana on Saturday. 
He says he wants to meet with students during his trip and urges them to choose majors they're passionate about.
