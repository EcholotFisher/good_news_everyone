How long does it take you to spot the drowning child? For one lifeguard, it was mere seconds before she noticed the boy and jumped in to save him.
The video, posted on YouTube by Lifeguard Rescue , shows a wavepool full of people in rubber tubes. But 10 seconds into the video, Time reports, one of the people slips from their rubber tube and began to flail in the water. Immediately seeing this, the lifeguard leaps from the side and rushes to the drowning child, saving him seconds after the initial slip occurred.
Pool The video has been viewed 14.9 million times as of Monday. Though Time hasn't found out where the incident took place, the video cites The Genesis Project out of the Charleston, S.C. area. The Genesis Project was started following a May 2014 drowning of a 13-year-old boy, Genesis Holmes.
The reaction time of the lifeguard is impressive especially after CNN reports that actual lifeguards have admitted to not being able to watch everyone while on the job.
One lifeguard told CNN that “even the best lifeguards can miss something while watching a crowded beach with over 200 swimmers.” While the wavepool wasn’t a beach full of people, the sheer volume of swimmers made the feat just as impressive.
