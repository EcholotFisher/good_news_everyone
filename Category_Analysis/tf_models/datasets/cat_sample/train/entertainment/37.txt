Jerry Seinfeld was spotted excitedly showing love for the New York Mets in Sunday's game against the Cubs, but there was one time when Seinfeld displayed fandom for the Cubs.
In May 2008, Seinfeld was photographed wearing a Cubs hat with a sticker attached to the bill as he sat in the stands at Wrigley Field. The event was documented on the blog clubhousecancer.com.
The hat "was given to him by the Cubs on a visit to Wrigley. Worn once," Seinfeld's publicist Tom Keaney said in an email to the Tribune.
Perhaps Seinfeld, a native New Yorker, was following baseball game etiquette outlined in a 1992 episode of "Seinfeld," when Elaine Benes (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) was ejected from a New York Yankees game for refusing to take off her Baltimore Orioles hat while sitting in the Yankees owners box.
The Cubs face off against the Mets for Game 3 of the National League Championship Series Tuesday at Wrigley Field. The Mets lead the series 2-0.
