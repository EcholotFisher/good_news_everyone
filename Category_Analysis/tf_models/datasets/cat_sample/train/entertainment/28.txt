LONDON (AP) — An adult Harry Potter and his son Albus Severus will take center stage in a theatrical sequel to J.K. Rowling's magical book series. 
Producers revealed Friday that "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" will open where Rowling's books ended — 19 years after the boy wizard's epic battle with Lord Voldemort. 
A synopsis says Harry is now an overworked civil servant in the Ministry of Magic, while his youngest son is struggling "with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted." 
The play will run in two parts that can be seen either on the same day or different days. It opens July 30 at London's Palace Theatre. 
The first-ever play about the bespectacled wizard it is based on a new story by Rowling, scriptwriter Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany.
