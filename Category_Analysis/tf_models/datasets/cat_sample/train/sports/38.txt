HAMMOND, LA (WVUE) - Two people were killed Wednesday when a plane crashed near the Hammond North Shore Regional Airport approach around 3:50 p.m., according to the Hammond Police Department.
The two were the only ones aboard the twin-engine Cessna 421. It appeared that the airplane was taking off but encountered some kind of trouble and tried return, according to an FAA spokesperson. When emergency responders reached the scene, the plane was fully engulfed in flames.
“ We do have a station on the airport, it responded right away, it did confirm we had a plane down that was engulfed in fire at the time, our units arrived on scene and started putting the fire out as they were responding ,” John Thomas, the Hammond Fire Chief, said.
Thomas said it was unclear if the pilot attempted to call for help.
“T he airport tower was aware of the situation, I can't confirm if it was by radi o or by line of sight, but I'm sure [the plane] was capable of radio , but whether there was anything transmitted, we don't know ,” Thomas said.
The identities of the victims have not been released.
Officials would not release details about the plane's origin or destination. The Federal Aviation Administration is handling the investigation and will release more information Thursday.
The NTSB and a representative from Cessna’s engine manufacturer are expected on the scene Thursday to try and determine what happened before the crash.
