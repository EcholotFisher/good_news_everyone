Associated Press SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - California has passed a law requiring local law enforcement to provide paperwork for immigrant crime victims applying for visas to remain in the country legally so long as they are otherwise eligible for the federal government program.
The law signed by Gov. Jerry Brown is the first such statewide measure aimed at making it easier for victims of crimes including rape and domestic violence to apply for the visas.
Until now, some law enforcement have provided immigrants with the required paperwork documenting the crime and their assistance with an investigation, while others have been loath to do so.
Advocates say they hope the new law will address the discrepancy. It is one of a spate of measures enacted in California this year to help immigrants in the country illegally.
