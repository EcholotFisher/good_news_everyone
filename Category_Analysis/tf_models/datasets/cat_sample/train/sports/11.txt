With financial interests in the mining and energy sectors, he is estimated to be worth some $200m (£130.6m). 
During the apartheid era he was imprisoned on Robben Island alongside late South African president Nelson Mandela. 
He became a close friend of Mr Mandela's and served as a cabinet minister after South Africa embraced democracy. 
He is also the former host of South Africa's version of "The Apprentice". 
FIFA is to elect its new president on 26 February following Mr Blatter's resignation earlier this year. 
Mr Blatter and Mr Platini, who was previously the favourite to win the election, were both provisionally suspended for 90 days after Swiss prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into a £1.35m payment from Mr Blatter to Mr Platini earlier this month.
