MOORHEAD, Mississippi — A lengthy fight ended a junior college game between East Mississippi and Mississippi Delta on Thursday night. 
East Mississippi had a 48-0 lead over Mississippi Delta in the final minute of the first half when both benches cleared and a fight ensued. 
An East Mississippi receiver was tackled out of bounds late in the first half. The player was shoved back to the ground while out of bounds, which instigated the fight. 
Several Mississippi Delta players joined the altercation and EMCC's bench emptied as well. 
Police eventually took the field and with the help of coaches and administrators regained control. Following a meeting officials called the game.
