Multiple sources are reporting that Steve Spurrier is retiring. 
A Sports Illustrated article stated that the 70-year-old told his team of his plans Monday evening. 
There's been talk of when Spurrier was going to leave the Gamecocks for some time now, starting with his comments in the off season that he was going to last two or three more seasons. 
As it turns out, it looks like he won't even last that long. 
Multiple sources, including Sports Illustrated, Gamecock Central and Football Scoop.com are reporting that the head ball coach told his team Monday evening that he is retiring effective immediately. 
It seems shocking that Spurrier would choose to walk away in the middle of a season, but this has probably been his most challenging year with the Gamecocks since coming aboard in 2005. 
At 70 years old he may have just decided it wasn't worth the stress to go through the last couple of months of the season. 
Spurrier has taken the team to unseen success in his 11 years in Columbia including three 11-2 seasons, a trip to the SEC title game and five bowl wins including each of the last four seasons. 
Reports are that the school will name an interim head coach at the weekly presser on Tuesday. 
Co-defensive coordinators Jon Hoke and Lorenzo Ward or Steve Spurrier Jr. could all be considered for that position. 
The school has not returned an email seeking comment.
