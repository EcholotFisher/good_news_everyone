The Philadelphia Phillies will name Matt Klentak as their new general manager, according to multiple reports Saturday. Cancer-stricken Flip Saunders to miss... 
Klentak, who previously worked with Phillies president Andy MacPhail in Baltimore, will replace Ruben Amaro Jr., who held the position from 2008-15. 
Amaro was fired in September with the Phillies on the way to a major-league-worst 63-99 record and a second straight last-place finish in the National League East. 
Klentak was the Orioles' director of baseball operations in 2008 at the age of 27 while working under MacPhail. 
Klentak, 35, spent the last four seasons as an assistant general manager with the Los Angeles Angels. He interviewed for the Angels' recent GM vacancy, but the team hired Billy Eppler.
