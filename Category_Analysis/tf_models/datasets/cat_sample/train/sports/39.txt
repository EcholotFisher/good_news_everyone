SAN DIEGO (AP) — Philip Rivers threw for 503 yards and the San Diego Chargers still couldn’t pull off an upset of the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. 
Now the Chargers turn their attention to the AFC West starting with Sunday’s home game against the Oakland Raiders, who are at once a longtime rival and a possible future stadium partner in a Los Angeles suburb. 
Safety Eric Weddle notes that the quickest way to the playoffs is by winning the division. 
One big problem, though, is that four-time defending division champion Denver is 6-0, including 2-0 in the AFC West. 
San Diego finished 2-4 in the division last year, winning only the two games against last-place Oakland. 
The Chargers dropped to 2-4 after Sunday’s gut-wrenching 27-20 loss to the Packers.
