The Washington Capitals are coming off an impressive 4-1 win Thursday against the Chicago Blackhawks , and now they have their top center back. Nicklas Backstrom, who missed the first three games of the season while recovering from hip surgery, will make his season debut on the second line . 
Capitals Coach Barry Trotz said there willl be no restrictions on Backstrom tonight, but should he get fatigued, Trotz said he has the flexibility to move Andre Burakovsky up to second-line center. Burakovsky had occupied the second-line center role while Backstrom was out, but he got bumped back to fourth-line right wing against the Hurricanes .
