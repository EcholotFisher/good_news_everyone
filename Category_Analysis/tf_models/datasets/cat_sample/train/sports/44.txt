MEXICO CITY (AP) — Colombian coach Juan Carlos Osorio has taken charge of Mexico’s national team, becoming the 12th person to lead “El Tri” in the last nine years. 
Osorio takes over from interim head coach Ricardo Ferretti, who had been in the job since Miguel Herrera was fired in July after he punched a TV reporter at an airport. 
Osorio will make his debut in two World Cup qualifiers next month, when Mexico hosts El Salvador and travels to Honduras. 
The 53-year-old coach told a news conference Wednesday that he is excited about this “great opportunity.” 
Osorio was most recently coach of Sao Paulo FC. He stepped down last week after five months with the Brazilian club. Topics:
