The adoration was evident during the euphoric scenes at Valderama in 1997 as Ballesteros captained the European team to a dramatic Ryder Cup victory on his home soil over the Americans.There is perhaps no greater example of Ballesteros\\' legacy in Spain than current world No. 2 Jon Rahm, one of the favorites to claim the Green Jacket this year.\"Because of that 1997 Ryder Cup, and that Seve spirit, that aura, that something that Seve had, my family started playing golf and I\\'m here because of it,\" Rahm said. \"He was a pioneer of golf, not only in Spain but Europe, and when I tell people they don\\'t usually believe me. When he started playing golf, I think there was about 15,000 people that were licensed to play golf in Spain, when he died there was 350,000 people.\"Olazabal uses the shoulders of Ballesteros to get a better view of the hole during the 29th Ryder Cup in 1991.

If he wins the Green Jacket, he\\'ll be the third Spaniard to follow in Ballesteros\\' footsteps  -- after Olazabal and Sergio Garcia.\"It\\'s crazy to think of his story, right?

Pictured here is star Ellen Pompeo in the episode.This story contains spoilers from the season premiere of \"Grey\\'s Anatomy.\"  (CNN)It\\'s a McDream come true.  Patrick Dempsey\\'s Derek Shepherd made a shocking return in the season premiere of ABC\\'s \"Grey\\'s Anatomy,\" sending longtime viewers into a frenzy on Thursday night over the reappearance of the deceased character. For those who missed it, the two-hour episode was both a catch-up and an introduction to the world of \"Grey\\'s Anatomy\" amid coronavirus. The pandemic portions of the episode were set in April 2020, just weeks into the global health emergency that in real life shuttered production on the series back in March, before they could finish filming the final episodes of their season.In the episode, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) spends most of her time fully suited up in PPE and treating patients in the Covid ward at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. At the end of the episode, Meredith is found by another doctor having collapsed in the parking lot. Read MoreBefore more information on her condition could be made clear, the action switches to a beach, where Meredith is standing watching the waves. As her voice over ends, she hears a voice calling her name and turns to see her dead husband standing down the shore, waving his arms.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Grey\\'s Anatomy Official (@greysabc) Dempsey\\'s character was killed off in season 11 and has only been seen in archival footage since. A preview for next week\\'s episode hints that there will be more to see from Meredith and Derek\\'s on-screen reunion but does little to clear up the context of it. Is it a coma dream? A near-death experience? A hallucination? To be determined. Pompeo was cagey in her post-episode appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" But said putting it together was rewarding because they knew that viewers were \"going to freak out.\" \"And we all know 2020 has been a really long, ugly road. And we were so happy just to be able to film these scenes and know how much joy it was going to bring people,\" she said. \"Grey\\'s Anatomy\" airs Thursdays on ABC. ',\n",

Why is the stock market soaring?Hong Kong (CNN Business)China has just joined forces with more than a dozen countries across the Asia Pacific region to sign a huge free trade deal nearly a decade in the making. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership spans 15 countries and 2.2 billion people, or nearly 30% of the world\\'s population, according to a joint statement released by the nations on Sunday, when the deal was signed. Their combined GDP totals roughly $26 trillion and they account for nearly 28% of global trade based on 2019 data. The deal includes several of the region\\'s heaviest economic hitters aside from China, including Japan and South Korea. New Zealand and Australia are also partners, as are Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam in Southeast Asia.The trade agreement was first proposed in 2012 as a way to create one of the world\\'s largest free-trade zones. It\\'s tough to gauge the immediate economic significance of the deal. The members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — a group of 10 countries that signed the agreement — said that it would eliminate tariffs and quotas on 65% of the goods that are traded in the region. Asia\\'s economies are bouncing back. The West is headed in the other directionRead MoreThe partner countries also noted the importance of the agreement as the world tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, saying in a joint statement that the deal \"will play an important role in building the region\\'s resilience through inclusive and sustainable post-pandemic economic recovery process.\"\"Its symbolic value has always exceeded its actual value,\" said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council. He pointed out that India opted out of the deal late last year, lessening the importance of the agreement in terms of actual trade. Reinsch said, though, that the agreement could have consequences in the long term, and added that China\\'s involvement \"is a sign of its willingness to play a constructive role, despite its aggressive actions in the South China Sea, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.\"China and Australia, for example, have been caught up in trade disputes lately, but that hasn\\'t stopped them pressing ahead with the RCEP. \"Both countries see huge benefits from their deeper economic integration with other Asian countries,\" said Murray Hiebert, senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at CSIS. \"The RCEP could potentially provide Beijing and Canberra another platform where they could discuss and hammer out their differences.\"The US-China rivalry in tech and trade won\\'t end because Joe Biden is presidentOthers noted that the deal was further evidence of Asia\\'s growing power. Economists at HSBC said Sunday that the agreement \"signals that Asia keeps pushing ahead with trade liberalization even as other regions have become more skeptical.\"\"It may reinforce a trend that\\'s been already underway for decades: that the global center of economic gravity keeps pushing relentlessly to the East,\" they wrote in a research note.Leaving the US behind?It\\'s not clear whether the deal will have an impact on the most important global trading relationship of all: That between the United States and China, who have been fighting over trade and related issues for the last few years.\"Whether it means a shift in the regional dynamic in favor of China depends on the US response,\" Reinsch said of the new trade deal. He pointed to the importance of the election of Joe Biden, who will succeed President Donald Trump in January. \"If the US continues to ignore or bully the countries there, the influence pendulum will swing toward China,\" he added. \"If Biden has a credible plan to restore the US presence and influence in the region, then the pendulum could swing back our way.\"The United States famously bailed on the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a major trade deal that would have cemented stronger relationships with several countries in Asia Pacific, including Japan, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam — when Trump took office.  Since then, the United States has done some bilateral deals, including a 2018 agreement with South Korea and this year\\'s truce with China. But it hasn\\'t done a comprehensive regional trade agreement.\"Given the shortcomings of RCEP, we would not recommend the United States joining,\" said Myron Brilliant, US Chamber of Commerce executive vice president and head of international affairs. \"The United States should however adopt a more forward-looking, strategic effort to maintain a solid US economic presence in the region. Otherwise, we risk being on the outside looking in as one of the world\\'s primary engines of growth hums along without us,\" Brilliant added.— Jake Kwon and Akanksha Sharma contributed to this report.

Beyond says customers will be served its rendition as a ramen topping, and in dishes such as spaghetti and meatballs, spicy bolognaise, and biscuits and gravy. (The company has made plant-based pork before, though in the form of a sausage product.)Starting Wednesday, customers in Shanghai will be able to try the new product at five local restaurants for a limited time.\"We\\'re excited to launch Beyond Pork in China, marking a milestone for Beyond Meat,\" Candy Chan, the company\\'s general manager for China, said in a statement. \"We are not only launching an entirely new product innovation, but our first plant-based meat product created specifically for the Chinese market.\"Read MoreShe noted that the product\\'s \"exclusive debut in China furthers Beyond Meat\\'s commitment to this important market.\" Beyond Meat serving its new crunchy pork \"bite\" at a tasting in China on Wednesday. Beyond\\'s latest introduction could come as a welcome alternative for Chinese consumers, especially right now.China, which has long been the world\\'s biggest consumer of pork, entered a major production crisis last year due to an outbreak of African swine fever. The disruption forced some consumers to temporarily switch to other types of meat.Before that, pork had accounted for about 70% of China\\'s overall meat consumption, according to official Chinese data.This year, Chinese pig farmers have seen some recovery, allowing them to boost supply and ease prices, analysts at Rabobank wrote in a recent research report.But globally, \"producers face a challenging outlook, given rising feed costs, weaker economic trends, and slower export growth as China rebuilds its domestic hog supply,\" they wrote.Battle over ChinaBeyond has been on a roll in mainland China, a vast market that is seen as vital for the US company\\'s growth. Earlier this year, the firm announced a partnership with Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) to bring Beyond Burgers to supermarket shelves in mainland China for the first time. It had also rolled out products in some of the country\\'s most popular fast food chains, including KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. That came just weeks after the company unveiled a big tie-up with Starbucks (SBUX), to get its meatless pastas, lasagnes and wraps on Chinese menus.McDonald\\'s announces new chicken sandwich and \\'McPlant\\' burgerThe firm also recently struck a deal with a local food distributor, Sinodis, which will help the company supply restaurants and caterers in China.But for all its momentum, competition is fierce. While the fake meat trend is still taking shape in mainland China, Beyond is going up against other popular brands, including fellow California upstart Impossible Foods, which has signaled plans for its own launch there. Last month, Impossible launched its fake beef product in supermarkets in Hong Kong and Singapore, hoping to widen its footprint across Asia and tap into an increased demand for home cooking spurred by the pandemic.— Laura He contributed to this report.',\n",

We wish him and Abdel and their families only the best moving forward.\"The move signals the Suns\\' intentions of becoming an immediate play-off contender in the Western Conference, with Paul joining Devin Booker, one of the most exciting young players in the league, in the backcourt.Phoenix grabbed the early headlines in the NBA\\'s Disney Bubble by going on an incredible 8-0 run during the seeding games. Though the team eventually fell short of the play-in game for the eighth and final play-off place, there was a sense of excitement and expectation that the young team could carry that form into the new season.Eastern ConferenceElsewhere, the Milwaukee Bucks are doing everything possible to convince back-to-back MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo to sign a new contract by reportedly acquiring Jrue Holiday from the New Orleans Pelicans and Bogdan Bogdanovic from the Sacramento Kings.Giannis Antetokounmpo has until December 21 to sign his supermax contract.Antetokounmpo has until December 21 to sign his five-year supermax contract, with his current deal set to expire at the end of the upcoming season when the 25-year-old will become an unrestricted free agent.In return for Bogdanovic, the Kings will reportedly receive Donte DiVincenzo, Ersan Ilyasova and DJ Wilson, while the Pelicans will receive Eric Bledsoe, George Hill, three first round picks and two future picks in exchange for Holiday.Ever since the Bucks\\' stunning 4-1 defeat to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference semifinals, rumors of a move away from Milwaukee for Antetokounmpo have been circulating, with the Heat touted as the most likely destination.
