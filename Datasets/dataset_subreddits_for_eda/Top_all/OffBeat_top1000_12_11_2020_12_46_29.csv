I realized this quickly but my phone was dead and couldn't call my friends who dropped me off. It's 11 at night I have no idea where I am or which direction to go...

I start walking around, trying to get any car to stop to at least give me some directions. I was in some bizarre industrial area where there were no shops, stores, or really much of anything. 

Finally, I get someone to stop. It's a guy with a mohawk covered in tats. He tells me where I am, where I need to go, and that it's going to take me a really long time to get there. I thank him and he pulls away. 

I start walking and about ten minutes later he shows up again and offers me a ride most of the way to where I'm going (about 10 miles). As he was driving away the first time, he realized that I was in a tough spot and was going to have a hell of a time getting home. I happily accept the ride.

We have a nice chat as he drives me up to where I'm going.

It wasn't the 100 SUVs, or middle-aged parents, or ""normal"" people who decided to help me, it was the guy with arms full of tattoos and a mohawk who offered me help. So to anyone who drove past me as I tried to wave you down last night, ""fuck you"" (though I understand). And to my new friend, ""thanks a lot man, you're a life saver.""





tl;dr: Dropped off in wrong area at 11pm with no phone and nothing around, got help from Mohawked guy with lots of tattoos. Fuck yeah for nice people. "
