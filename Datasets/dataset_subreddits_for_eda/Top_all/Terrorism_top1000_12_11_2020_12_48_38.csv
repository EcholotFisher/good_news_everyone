From a layman's glance it seems outright bizarre that this freakish Pashton-nationalist deobandi Jihadist organisation has survived for so long - over decades and generations - against a government backed by a coalition of some of the world's most advanced military forces. Last I read, the Taliban has been making major territorial gains in just the past year with a growing fighting force and access to the arms blackmarket. How is this possible that they have the capacity to do this, after a multiple-decade long war focused on wiping them out?

Is it to do with Opium trade, and Talibani impunity in Pashtun-regions of Pakistan like in Quetta, FATA, Peshawar or Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa? Is foreign funding from islamists a big thing? How are they getting new recruits after 40 years of them terrorising cities and the countryside? Are there Madrasahs/Islamic Schools which are brainwashing children? Is there a large base of pro-Taliban sympathisers amongst the overall Pashtun population? Is Pashtun tribal society and culture itself an enabler for Taliban recruitment? Without proper understanding of the situation it just seems bizarre that they're still there wreaking havoc."

Hero Abdul Aziz,15,1.0,b21ytb,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrorism/comments/b21ytb/hero_abdul_aziz/,1,2019-3-17,"It is, without a doubt a difficult thing to comprehend, man’s inhumanity to man. This weekend, like many in Christchurch, my heart aches with it. I was not personally affected, no one I know was killed but I, and I suspect most people in Christchurch, feel violated and betrayed.

Australian, \[nameless murderer\] killed 49 people in two mosques in Christchurch as they gathered for prayers. \[nameless murderer\] knew that his victims were unarmed. He knew that they were peaceful. A quote from his 78 page manifesto, shows that was the point, “The unarmed invader is far more dangerous to our people than the armed invader ”.

I assume that his reference to ‘our people’ is meant to exclude immigrants, Muslims, anyone outside some narrow band of Australian/New Zealand society.

By the way, there is little need to read his manifesto. At worst it is a divisive document inspired by political figures such as Donald Trump and the likes of Australian Senator Fraser Anning. At best it is a cautionary tale about neglecting education and the subsequent rise of ignorance.

As the news broke of the first mosque killings my colleagues and I were shocked. We were locked in our building, listening to news, rumours, and almost disbelieving as the number of casualties rose. Since then the people of Christchurch have struggled with the enormity of the calamity. Today though, I read one story that gives me hope for humanity. It is the story of the man who chased off the gunman, scaring him into the arms of the police.

After \[nameless murderer\] had killed 41 people at Masjid Al Noor Mosque as they gathered for Friday prayers, he proceeded to another mosque in Linwood in the eastern suburbs to continue his killing spree. That is where he met his match. Abdul Aziz was in the Linwood mosque when the shooter opened fire killing 7 more worshipers.

Abdul Aziz, armed only with a credit card machine, ran outside to confront the gunman, yelling “Come here !” The gunman was forced to return to his vehicle to grab another weapon and then fired at Abdul Aziz, who managed to dodge behind cars. When the gunman returned to his car a second time Abdul Aziz picked up the gunman’s spent weapon and threw it, smashing the gunman’s windscreen. The terrified gunman sped away with Abdul Aziz chasing him down the street. A short time later, police forced \[nameless murderer\] off the road and arrested him.

I will remember the name of Abdul Aziz. I will remember and celebrate his bravery. I am glad that he was here. His heroism is an inspiration.

Now, as people all across New Zealand gather for vigils in support of its Muslim community and the families of victims, I would like to ask some questions of anyone as they ponder the issues of immigration: Who would you rather come to New Zealand, \[nameless murderer\] or Abdul Aziz? Who would you prefer to be ‘our people’?

We just published an [article](https://ammo.com/articles/italian-years-of-lead-strategy-of-tension-foreshadow-america-future-civil-war) about it, but one quote by Italy's Christian Democratic Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga struck me in particular:

*""Unlike leftist terrorism, which strikes at the heart of the state through its representatives, right-wing terrorism prefers acts such as massacres because acts of extreme violence promote panic and impulsive reactions.""*

Is this true? I mean, there are exceptions like McVeigh who definitely did target the state, but for the most part is Cossiga right about two different types of terrorism?"

Terrorist Grooming in Birmingham UK,12,0.88,9g1xxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrorism/comments/9g1xxi/terrorist_grooming_in_birmingham_uk/,2,2018-9-15,"As someone who spent their late teens/early 20's living in Sparkhill in what I can only describe as ""Birmingham's Ghetto"", I learned alot more about terrorist grooming cells than I ever wanted to or imagined I would.

We lived not far from the formans road gym which had just been shot up by a hitman. It was rumoured to have been the result of a dispute between the victim and a notorious gangster known to us all only as ""big sully"". Although noone was ever caught or convicted for the murder of the man who died in the shooting. 

Another 24 hour gym (male only) was opened on stoney lane years later by a family member of mine (Fam member A) and it became the new hotspot for young Muslim men and boys who were bored, listless and had nowhere to go at 2am when they were high and tired of roaming the streets.  Another family member of mine (fam member B) suddenly started going there obsessively.  

My partner decided to go one day after coming in from work late and brought home a pile of wahabbi literature which he'd been given. I am Muslim... But I didn't recognize any of this material. It was... Extreme. The word ""kafir"" was mentioned alot. My partner said the owner of the gym (Fam Member A) had sat him down and lectured him for a long time... My partner was confused about alot that was said and concerned about the literature he was given , having newly converted, as he found it hateful. 

I didn't know what to make of it and took it to my mum, who binned it muttering ""wahabi bastards"" or something of the sort and we all got on with our lives.

I saw family member B on the roads collecting money for charity over the next few years. He'd grown a long beard and was wearing thobes... 

And then I saw his face plastered all over the news. 

MI5 had been following him for months. Recording conversations... Tracing movements and purchases. The ""charity"" money was to make bombs.  They were plotting a terror attack on London and they'd been stopped.

But the groomers hadn't.

Last I'd heard Fam member A had been jailed for fraud. But that was a while back and it was one of those Chinese whispers scenarios. So y'know.  

I've tried to condense a very long, very complex story that involves alot of people and fam member A was not the only one who was involved in the grooming here. There were others who'd set up ""meetings"" in their homes and nothing happened to them.

It's always the older men with families that sit back and do the brainwashing and then get away with it because they aren't on the front line. 

I think I mainly wrote this because I wanted to raise awareness. If your child/brother/nephew/friend is disappearing late at night and gets agitated when you don't let them go...if there's a change in their behaviour and they start following the wahabi fikh out of nowhere or bringing home wahabi/extremist literature ... They may be being groomed by a terror cell.   Pay an interest in who they hang around with and where they go.

 Talk to your children. I've seen good kids get brainwashed because they were isolated and desparate for guidance, direction and purpose. Desparate to feel like they belonged somewhere and someone cared about them. Groomers make them feel like they are the centre of the universe. That they are heroes and yes, ultimately martyrs. 

I am not trying to minimise such a complex issue or pretend I'm an expert. 

I'm just leaving my two pence..

Question: Is globalization partly to blame for terrorism?,10,1.0,5qxp1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrorism/comments/5qxp1h/question_is_globalization_partly_to_blame_for/,3,2017-1-30,"*Note: When I mean 'globalization' I'm talking about IT technology not the new developments of the global economy*

Alright, so I've been on a McLuhan binge for quite a while. (For those who don't know, McLuhan was a famous philosopher who wrote about how the new electronic age would fundamentally change the human condition.) And I'm wondering if there's any relationship between his work and terrorism today. 

McLuhan came up with the term ""the global village"" which to him was what civilization was becoming. With the development of ICT systems we have effectively destroyed the space between us and others, which has made us more conscious of ourselves and more worried for the sanctity of our identities. Essentially, the electronic age would make us retreat to these same identities and act in a more tribal manner with our neighbours who are different than us. Hence us becoming a 'global village'. 

According to McLuhan, this retreat would fail somehow. (I don't know exactly how, but in a lot of his lectures he'd repeat how Western man had lost his identity because of the electronic age) When we lose our identities we'd then become violent, hence another quote of his: 

>Violence is essentially the quest for identity. 

I'm going to read more on McLuhan to get what he meant by all of this (I've mostly listened to his lectures), but I wonder if any of y'all with agree with the idea. If my summary is right, McLuhan makes two claims here: 

1. That IT erasing space between people can cause a lost of identity 

2. That this loss inevitably will make us violent 

What do you think? "

Islam vs The West.

A few Muslims will come out as pro-West (like Maajid Nawaz) but most will be well under the spell of the mosque, and will fight for their faith.

Wet governments who still don't realise The West is already at war (and still actually buy the 'religion of peace' narrative) will quickly lose out to more right wing parties who can see what's going on and will protect the indigenous people. There will be great civil unrest as vigilante groups start taking the fight to Muslim areas.

I'd love to see decent Muslims stand up against the radical Islamists, but polls show that many are sympathetic to their extremist brothers, and this means that many 'moderate' Muslims will get caught in the crossfire. A few questions:

Do you think there will be mass deportations? If so, based on what criteria?

How will governments respond to these civil wars. What will this all look like to ordinary Europeans?

When Islamists get their hands on nukes, where will they target first?"

Obviously I'm still angry about the war crimes that were unnecessary but everything else seems to have worked. Any thoughts?
