The statement also states that his heart beat has stopped for a brief period of time. This is due to a tear gas bomb had directly hit the driver.

The driver was sent to a hospital and has regained consciousness.

Such act is violating humanitarian principles as journalists should be protected from being attacked by both parties. The driver has clearly indicated his identity as a journalist as he has worn a fluorescent vest while on duty.

Please spread this news and let the world condemn such barbaric and uncivilized act.
