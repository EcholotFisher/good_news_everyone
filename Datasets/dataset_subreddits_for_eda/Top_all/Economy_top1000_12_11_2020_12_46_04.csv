"If Trump calls for TikTok to do business in US directly from US (including: have US investors hold a majority stake, save data on servers that are in the US, have its proprietary algorithms under direct control of US authorities basically) - why shouldn't the EU demand the same from US tech firms?",415,0.93,iwcaco,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/iwcaco/if_trump_calls_for_tiktok_to_do_business_in_us/,133,2020-9-20,"I do sympathise with US politics when it considers TikTok to be a potential threat to national security which should therefore be regulated. After all, it's known how social media can be used to spread fake news and meddle with elections.

However, how is TikToks's business modell in the US different from US tech firms' business model in Europe (and, indeed, in the US itself)?

It is stated that TikTok has the potential to become a threat to national security. However, US social media have already proven that they are a threat by not being able to control the spread of fake news and by meddling with elections, both in Europe (Brexit comes to mind) and in the US itself. For a lot of reasons, social medias' influence in Europe (and basically in the US itself) could be considered negative and threatening.

Unless there's something that I can't see, I'd say that a double standard is being applied.

US corporations have US politics in their pockets and they use their influence to push their own agenda which doesn't have the American people's best interest in mind.

Democracy is dead since the 70's when fiat currencies moved off the gold standard."
