To those joining us from r/all and r/popular:

We purposely posted this announcement a day in advance to give frequent visitors an opportunity to subscribe before we disappear from those pages, not expecting that the post itself would make it to the top of r/all. Sorry if this generates any confusion.

If you're a new subscriber, welcome! Please [**read the guidelines**](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralNews/wiki/guidelines) before participating.

----

Dear users,

Over the last few weeks, a number of posts from this subreddit have hit r/all and/or r/popular.

The appearances in those places have driven considerable traffic to the subreddit and swelled our subscriber numbers, but have also attracted contributors who are not only unaccustomed to our rules, but have no interest in abiding by them. This, in turn, has diminished the quality of discourse in the comments and increased the workload for the mods.

So, although growth has its benefits, we’ve determined that the growth we receive from r/all and r/popular is not the kind that is beneficial to this subreddit, especially with the current state of the larger Reddit culture.

Therefore, as of tomorrow, we will opt out of r/all, and consequently, r/popular. From then on, **if you want to see posts from r/NeutralNews on your front page, you’ll have to be subscribed and logged in.**

We do expect this to slow our growth, so if you happen to participate in conversations elsewhere with people you think would appreciate this kind of political discussion environment, feel free to refer them here, because we’re unlikely to attract many subscribers from other avenues after this move.

Thank you.

— r/NeutralNews mod team

[META] The status of r/NeutralNews,454,0.99,cim6kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/cim6kf/meta_the_status_of_rneutralnews/,112,2019-7-28,"Dear users,

Many of you have been wondering why r/NeutralNews has been locked to new submissions.

For a long while now, the mods have been discussing among themselves the nature of discourse on this sub and the level of moderation that discourse requires. Our vision for the sub was that it would be a place where people engage in reasonable and measured fact-based discussions of current events, and we feel that mission has not been realized. r/NeutralNews has proven much more difficult for a small team of moderators to manage than the considerably larger sub that spawned it, r/NeutralPolitics. This has led to widespread moderator burnout.

Two months ago, the mods had an extensive discussion about whether to shut down the subreddit. There was a strong contingent in favor, but instead, we decided to enact a series of sweeping reforms in a last ditch effort to get things back on track. Unfortunately, our depleted mod team has left us with a lack of person-hours to implement those reforms. In an effort to get some relief, we've put out a call for new mods on r/NeutralPolitics. Once they are installed, trained, and up to speed, our hope is that it'll free up the rest of us to implement the reforms to r/NeutralNews.

In the meantime, we've had to close the subreddit to new submissions, because it is basically unmoderated now, which reflects poorly on our team and what we're trying to do. The plan is to open it back up with the reforms in place, hopefully within a couple weeks. However, there's still a strong feeling among the mods that it might be better to just shut it down, so if we're unable to implement changes significant enough to improve the quality, that's what we'll do.

If you want to help us get things moving and work to ensure this subreddit's future, we could use some volunteers with experience writing bots, scripts and the like.

Sorry for the late notice on all this. It was a tough week."

**Dear r/NeutralNews users,**

Eleven months ago, we [put this subreddit on hiatus](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/cim6kf/meta_the_status_of_rneutralnews/) to address some big, structural problems. We were ridiculously over-optimistic about the timeline for making the required changes, but now we're back!

Please review the [list of reforms we implemented and those that are forthcoming.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi274b/meta_rneutralnews_list_of_reforms/)

Feel free to comment below, but first, here are some anticipated questions and their corresponding answers:

----

**Why did you shut down?**

*In short, it became impossible to moderate this community. The volume of rule-breaking comments was so great that sometimes we'd accumulate hundreds of reports in just a few days, which was too many for our small mod team to review.*

*It also got a bit demoralizing for us to see such blatant and constant violation of our rules, which meant nobody on our team really wanted to moderate this subreddit any longer. That just made the problem worse and discussion quality plummeted.*

*It had started to become just like every other political discussion forum on the internet, with people closed-mindedly yelling at each other. We didn't start this subreddit to provide yet another platform for that, so we had to decide what to do with it.*

*Mods held a vote and the option to implement a sweeping set of reforms to address the problems barely won out over shutting it down altogether.*

**Why are you reopening now?**

*Most of the reforms have been implemented.*

**What are these measures designed to accomplish?**

*Improve discussion quality by making this subreddit easier for a small team to moderate.*

**Why did it take so long?**

*After the initial excitement for the project wore off, the team dwindled and left us with only one developer and one mod working on it. Both of them have lives and jobs, so progress was in fits and starts. These are volunteer positions, after all.*

**How can I help?**

*In a few different ways:*

* *Submit articles. While a discussion forum like /r/NeutralPolitics can survive with occasional gaps between submissions, a news subreddit needs a constant flow of new content. Both previous interations of r/NeutralNews suffered from having only a handful of users who submit articles, meaning the content is dominated by what interests those users. We've taken measures to mitigate that in this latest model by limiting submissions from each individual user, but it won't help diversify the content if nobody else posts; it'll just make the sub less active, which could easily kill it. So, if you run across an interesting news item, please submit it here.*

* *Follow the rules. A good proportion of rule-breaking comments require mod attention. Even if each one only takes a minute for a mod to review in context, make a decision, and take the appropriate action, those minutes add up. Whenever you check yourself and make sure you're complying with the rules, you're not only improving the quality of discussion here, but also contributing to the longevity of this forum by lessening mod workload.*

* *Become a mod. If you like this place and want to help out, consider [applying to become a moderator.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi28xr/meta_rneutralnews_needs_more_moderators/)*

* *Volunteer to code. If you're a developer with spare time and experience with Python, consider helping us improve what we've done and add more features. Send [modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralNews)*

* *Provide feedback. Follow the links in this post to [other discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2ckj/meta_request_for_user_feedback_on_specific_rules/) about the changes and comment with your thoughts.*"

Per our [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/cim6kf/meta_the_status_of_rneutralnews/) last week, r/NeutralNews remains closed to new submissions.

The mods have approved a package of reforms to make the subreddit run more smoothly and meet our goals, but since we're not yet sure which of them will be implemented, we're not announcing them yet.

Twelve software engineers volunteered to help us implement the more technical parts and there's been good progress so far. The one thing we're really lacking is someone with expertise writing Reddit bots, so if anyone reading this has that skill and the time to donate, please [message us.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fneutralnews)

We don't yet have a date for the relaunch, because we don't want to put anything out before it's ready, but I'd say it'll be at least a couple weeks more. We'll make another announcement when we have something to report.

Thanks for your continued patience.

[META] The first set of rule changes and notes for r/NeutralNews,258,0.98,4p69e0,https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/4p69e0/meta_the_first_set_of_rule_changes_and_notes_for/,57,2016-6-22,"Dear readers,

When we relaunched /r/NeutralNews one week ago, we were just hoping to surpass the 1,200 or so users we garnered in our first attempt. Three days later, we had more than *10 times* that number!

Thanks to all of you for your contributions. Please keep submitting, voting and commenting. A news subreddit is nothing without a constant flow of new content.

With the explosive growth has come the realization that our model, ported over from /r/NeutralPolitics, does not completely work on a links-only news subreddit. Therefore, based on our experience and the helpful feedback from various users, we're introducing our first set of rule changes for /r/NeutralNews.

Here they are:

----

**Post tagging.** Editorial/opinion pieces must be tagged as such. We want your feedback on what other tags to implement. Ideas so far are: [geographic location], breaking news, analysis, interview, poll.

**Titles.** Submissions must use the original title of the article, but may clarify the content with bracketed text. If the title is editorialized,  sensational or biased, the submission will be removed.

**Blacklist.** Sources that consistently prove to be biased or sensationalized will be subject to inclusion on a blacklist. To start with, the only prohibited sources are image hosting sites (imgur, etc.) and social media sites (facebook, twitter, etc.).

**Claims of expertise.** In comments, a user's claim to hold expertise on a topic does not absolve them of the requirement to back up any assertions of fact with sources.

**Paywalls.** Submissions that link to articles behind paywalls will be removed unless the submitter provides an alternative method of viewing the article for discussion purposes.

**Multiple submissions on the same news item.** If there are a significant number of posts about a specific item, we may remove similar ones or contain the whole topic to a megathread. The mod team reserves the right to discretion in these matters.

**Vote-based filtering.** Any submission that falls below a certain vote threshold (to be determined) is subject to removal. If brigading becomes an issue, moderators can manually approve submissions, so long as they comply with [our guidelines.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralNews/wiki/guidelines)

----

*Now, some background information and clarification...*

**What is ""news""?**

For the purposes of this subreddit, ""news"" is defined as *""topical information from trustworthy outlets.""*

The mod team reserves the right to determine whether a post qualifies as news and to remove those that don't.

**What is ""neutral""?**

Sources in r/NeutralNews, whether they be submissions or links in the comments, may not be overly biased. The determination of what is biased is left to the submitter and the mods' discretion, but we do maintain a small blacklist of sources.

For comments, there is no neutrality requirement. You are welcome to politely take a position, so long as you support it with qualified sources and state your reasoning, as noted in [the guidelines.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralNews/wiki/guidelines)

**Neutral /= uncensored**

This sub's framework is an extension of the /r/NeutralPolitics philosophy that heavy moderation, including removal of content that doesn't conform to [our guidelines,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralNews/wiki/guidelines) is essential to encouraging the kind of discussion we want to foster. It's not such a stretch to call such removal ""censorship."" Although we don't remove anything based on ideology, we *do very much* control for tone, respect, and compliance with our published guidelines.

A good portion of users here may have subscribed in response to incidents of censorship elsewhere on reddit, which means they may be expecting /r/NeutralNews to feature completely uncensored content. It does not. There are other subs for that. /r/NeutralNews is heavily moderated.

----

Thanks for your attention. Feel free to contribute feedback in the comments here. /r/NeutralNews is a work in progress.
