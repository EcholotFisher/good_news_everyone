It was evil enough of the fossil fuel companies to run decades long disinformation campaigns in order to legitimize climate deniers and fake the presence of a two sided debate on climate with phony scholarly articles.  Now though... as wildfires rip through the world and renewables/batteries get cheaper and cheaper, it feels just absolutely soul destroying the lengths they are going to in order to protect their golden goose, the fossil fuel market.  

State senators in Oregon walk out of voting procedures for carbon taxes and report to garrisoned bunkers of right wing militia men.  Fracking wells are sold off to smaller companies who claim bankruptcy and leave them to rot without decommissioning and sealing them off, leaving them to leak methane for lord knows how long.  Now the supreme court is about to be stacked and Republican groups are salivating at the deregulatory possibilities.  We essentially have a president and majority leader that are focused on maintaining the petrostate world order and destroying legacy bedrock environmental laws as well as dismantling Obama’s climate legacy. This is occurring instead of pouring every bit of effort, money, taxation, and regulation into transitioning the world to sustainable energy.  

America could be one of the leaders of this great transition by ending this idiotic trade war, teaming up with China, Germany, and the rest of Europe, and getting the job done.  Why will this never happen?   Conservatives in America are hell bent on maintaining the petrostate world order using bullcrap excuses like “it’s all part of God’s plan,” acquiescing to their rich donor overlords, and ensuring environmental and social governance will not be a priority at the federal and sometimes state level.   

I am a 33 year old male professional born and living in America.  I am in good health with no debt but the mortgage on my home, car and college paid off, $30k in the bank, bills 23% of income... have I bothered to reproduce? Nope.  Don’t even have a girlfriend right now or a dating app account.  I wonder what could be giving pause to my virile instincts?   Perhaps a giant world consuming environmental crisis? A global greenhouse gas experiment from hell is occurring?  Maybe I am feeling massively ashamed and embarrassed to call myself an American and call these craven lunatics my countrymen?  Worst of all, we are being governed by a dumb orange baboon that could care less about climate change and is concerned with nothing and nobody but his own ego?  Sorry had to rant a little."

* Sunrise — youth-oriented, pushing the Green New Deal. US only. Find a local hub [here](https://sunrisemovement.org/hubs).  Email the hub organizer to get involved.  They're volunteers, and often busy, so follow up if you don't hear back.
* Citizens Climate Lobby — broader age range, studiously bipartisan.  In the US CCL is pushing a revenue-neutral carbon tax and dividend bill,  [H.R. 763](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/763)You can find a signup form for Citizens Climate Lobby [here](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-silence7&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=silence7).Make sure you figure out where the monthly meeting is and attend.
* 350.org — This is the biggest and oldest climate group.  They're involved in a variety of actions, ranging from divestment to lobbying for state/province level and municipal legislation. Broad age range.  Local groups can be found [here](https://350.org/get-involved/)
* [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.earth/) believes in the use of nonviolent civil disobedience, including a willingness of large number of people to be arrested, on a large scale to create political change.  They are most active in the UK, but also have a significant number of active local chapters in the US and other countries.  Local chapters are mostly listed [here](https://rebellion.earth/act-now/local-groups/) but some in the US are only listed at [the bottom of this page](https://extinctionrebellion.us/).

If you want to find one that works for you, go down the list (and check the comments) and find out which ones are active near you.  Attend a meeting or action or two to get a sense of what the group is like, and then start doing more to help.

There are others, and depending on you and your community, another group might be the best choice.  If you don't feel that one of these group is a good fit for you, tell us where you are and what your community is like, and ask for help.

If you think there's something significant that one of the big groups isn't handling, ask about it.  Maybe somebody can help you figure out how to get it done."

This year's US election will impact climate policy: do more than vote,338,0.99,had2n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/had2n0/this_years_us_election_will_impact_climate_policy/,67,2020-6-17,"The Trump administration seems dedicated to [maximizing environmental damage](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html), while Biden has made [specific promises to start the process of decarbonization](https://joebiden.com/climate/).  Judges appointed by Trump will block any kind of environmental action for decades to come, while Biden appointees are likely to be amenable to the decarbonization we need.  The makeup of the Senate similarly will impact what legislation we can actually pass.

Here's what you need to do:

[Double-check your registration before election day](https://iwillvote.com/).  If you can take advantage of early voting, do so.  If you've already got a mail-in ballot, return it as soon as possible, preferably via a county-provided ballot drop-box.

Campaigns don't magically happen.  They need people power.  [Volunteer](https://www.mobilize.us/joebiden/).   Volunteer [full time between now and election day if you can](https://go.joebiden.com/page/s/late-help-gotv-with-biden-for-president).  

The Biden campaign also also needs money, which pays the salaries of organizers and to run ads.     You can [give whatever amount feels right for you to the Biden Victory Fund](https://act.joebiden.com/BVFraiser?attr=100839588).
 
The balance of power in the Senate is going to have a huge impact - it will decide whether we can pass decarbonization legislation, or whether we'll be limited to executive regulatory actions, which can easily be rolled back by the next President.  Pick a close senate race and get involved.  Some good choices are [Iowa](https://greenfieldforiowa.com/), [one of the Georgia races](https://electjon.com/), and [North Carolina](https://www.calfornc.com/)."

We really appreciate any signatures, although Japan has comitted to ""net zero"" carbon emissions by 2050, the reality of life here is very far from this aspiration. In Kobe city alone, planning permission has been granted for the expansion of a huge coal power plant which is due to run for 30 years. We hope that a declaration of Climate Emergency will make our government focus policies towards greener energy and inspire other local governments to do so too.

There is a summary [here](http://environmath.org/2018/06/17/paper-of-the-day-poore-nemecek-2018-reducing-foods-environmental-impacts/).

The 28% figure is in an erratum ([https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/eaaw9908](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/eaaw9908)), not in the original paper, because the authors had initially underestimated how much carbon could be sequestrated in soils and forests, if natural vegetation could grow back on land previously used for animal agriculture. They say ""In total, the ""no animal products"" scenario delivers a 28% reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions acroess all sectors of the economy relative to 2010 emissions"".

It can also be deduced from the data available in the article:

\-Food’s GHG emissions represent **26%** of global CO2eq emissions

\-Adopting a plant-based diet would cut food’s GHG emissions by **49%**

\-and free 3 billion hectares (>Africa’s surface), where **8.1 billion metric tons** of CO2eq could be sequestrated per year (for 100 years) as natural vegetation re-establishes and soil carbon re-accumulates

\-Global CO2eq emissions: **53 billion tons** of CO2eq ([https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)). This one is not in the article but is the consensual figure as far as I could tell.

So 0.26\*0.49\*53 + 8.1 = 0.1274\*53 + 8.1 = 6.7522 + 8.1 = 14.8522

"I’m so frustrated I need to rant. Shell are manipulating people people on YouTube with ads and it’s disgusting. Greg James, a radio personality in the UK has sold out - they’re trying to make themselves looks like eco warriors and their absolutely not!",247,0.97,dv1hzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/dv1hzo/im_so_frustrated_i_need_to_rant_shell_are/,22,2019-11-12,"Shell the gas and oil company have a terrible record with polluting and destroying the planet, every time I go onto YouTube I see more of their ads which are clearly targeted towards young people. I’ve commented on it so many times along with lots of other people, they have 21,000 likes to 14,000 dislikes. They’re doing some hydrogen based low emissions BS (which isn’t even that good for the planet as they’re not easily recycled) they are using modern marketing methods to reach young people and I think it’s absolutely disgusting. 

Shell are being sued, they have a bad human rights record, numerous spills and have torn the planet apart for money. I don’t know what I’m trying to achieve here but it’s so frustrating that every time I go onto YouTube I see this stupid set of videos. They’ve got Greg James, who I used to like to present and he’s absolutely sold out. 

Sorry if this is incoherent, I just needed to vent because they’re being manipulative. Just go onto google and look at what Shell are doing and you will see the terrible record they have. I wouldn’t normally just get so irate at a random company, there are lots of companies that aren’t doing there bit... but presenting themselves as being a positive contribution to save their image and ultimately make MORE MONEY by being manipulative is just awful. They totally suck. Thanks for listening."
