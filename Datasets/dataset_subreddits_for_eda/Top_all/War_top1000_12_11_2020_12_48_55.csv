SO FAR THIS IS WHAT THIS IS WHAT IS GOING ON.

‚Ä¢ As a response, Iran's head has vowed saying ""the criminals who did this will face a severe response"".

‚Ä¢ Pentagon just issued a warning saying they will proceed to take action to protect America.

‚Ä¢ American governing officials have been ecaved and moved to safe locations.

‚Ä¢ Turkey & other countries are mobilizing soldiers

‚Ä¢ the US is sending paratroopers and is increasing ""safety measures"" in the middle eastern bases.

‚Ä¢ The value of Gold, Silver and similar stuff is increasing in the stock market.
	
	‚ó¶ Similar to what happened before previous wars or conflict. Money is safe in commodities because the value won't significantly drop cause there's only a limited supply.

‚Ä¢ All major Russian, American and British news outlets announced that its highly if not certain that Iran will strike back using major force.

‚Ä¢ If Iran is attacked Russia will step in as they have a pact which will mean NATO will step up and mobilize its troop which could result in reserve troops being deployed, basically start a war.

‚Ä¢ Ex and current military members have gone on social media saying there's a huge huge huge chance of a World War 3"

it's a really nice area to take a walk.

In 2013 when I was still living in Aleppo, Syria, I was once with a friend in heated area helping him take stuff from his apartment to transfer to his current accommodation. On the way back there was an airstrike relatively close to us but we were fine. We immediately ran to the scene to help injured people and saw that a whole building collapsed. There was an injured man who we carried a few meters away from the site he was not conscious. After 20 mins he wakes up but still has the bresthing device on his mouth so he couldn't talk, he was trying to say something but we all thought he was just in pain, then I finally understood that he was trying to say ""My son is still under there"" I ran to the collapsed building and we started lifting rocks and debris. After what felt like ages we heard a cough and found the child, he was badly injured from all the debris. I carried him out and started to try and stop the bleeding. But he coughed one last time and died between my arms. Ahmad was 4 years old, and the hardest most devistating thing I ever had to do is hand his lifeless body to his father and watch that man's world collapse. He just started screaming his name in the hopes that he'd wake up. That day still haunts me almost on a weekly Basis. I don't know if I have PTSD and have never talked to a therapist about it. 

Ps. I live in Germany now since three years and I appreciate the gift of life every single day ever since."

We had left the UK for the Falkland Islands exactly 32 days ago and had been on the ground for many weeks. I was told that we had to move quickly to a new location and to set up a communications command for 10 Field Workshops who needed to organise and coordinate the growing number of Argentinian prisoners that we were now taking. Chris Golley and Mark (Fritz) Davies helped me to move our radio equipment and our personal kit about a kilometre (one click) and to resite the antenna's outside an animal shed in Port San Carlos. During the move we had an air raid red, we quickly dug in and returned fire on the low flying Argentinian aircraft that fired indiscriminately on our positions. This went on agonisingly until the guns of HMS Fearless gave out several huge ear-splitting explosions and plumes of smoke and blew the aircraft out of the sky. We watched as the enemy aircraft exploded into pieces and flames then crashed to the ground.
We were still reeling with grief and mortified by the loss of our 205 Signal Squadron OC Major Mike Forge and SSGT Joe Baker who had been killed in action. Fear and sadness had spread through us like a terminal virus. We felt leaderless and in a time of war that made us very nervous.

After having set up and tested communications we were given our first hot meal from the engineers since we had landed in the Falklands. Steak & Kidney pudding, powdered mashed potato and warm gravy.
We found a large piece of green tarpaulin which had been used to cover a helicopter and propped it over the outside animal pen to use as a cover from the extreme and cold weather and to store our kit underneath. Later we were joined by Rick Power and Alan Coleman who had become detached from our unit, 205 Signal Squadron, and needed to find somewhere bed down.

I called HQ and arranged for a helicopter to collect them but it wouldn't arrive until the following day so told them to stay with us for the night under the tarpaulin. In exchange for the hospitality, I asked Alan Coleman, who was a B2 Signaller and probably more importantly, had a GPMG and a load of ammunition, to join us on shift which gave my team more, much needed sleep as we were now near exhaustion and had had little sleep for what seemed weeks.

The difference between Hollywood and WAR IRL....,43,0.97,cl1vxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/cl1vxn/the_difference_between_hollywood_and_war_irl/,10,2019-8-2,"I've watched hundreds of videos of frontline combat from recent theaters of war from around the world these past couple of days..

here are some of the things i noticed

\> you rarely know where the gunfire is coming from initially  
\> by the time you zero in on an enemy position, your enemy has probably moved from theirs.  
\> frontline infantry basically handles suppression, it's the tanks, helicopters and the jets that rack up the kill count.  
\> Mortars, RPG's and larger ordinance if used effectively can end the fight instantly.  
\> Small arms fire rarely is effective for 100% suppression  
\> Snipers are deadly, even relatively unskilled snipers with good weapons can rack up kills in open-terrain combat.  
\> Sniper nests are vulnerable, it's not like you can camp out on the roof of a building forever and keep taking potshots, your first shot gives away your location, and if you don't move your ass, a mortal or RPG or tank round or a helicopter or a jet will totally fuck up your day.. The rule therefore is, be mobile and be deadly accurate, because one shot is all you are gonna get...   
\> Infantry goal is always fire suppression, basically asserting fire superiority / dominance to get your opponent to stop shooting by forcing constant fire on their location until you can bring in larger ordinance to actually kill them if they don't stop firing back.  
\> Infantry rarely engage in hand to hand combat or engage in glory kills as depicted in most movies.  
\> No you absolutely can't waltz into an enemy compound and destroy a dozen actively aware enemies with headshots from a pistol.  
\> If you don't take stock of how many bullets you have, you'll probably end up going dry at the worst possible moment and end up getting shot and killed as a result.  
\> no matter who you are, if you don't use cover effectively, you are likely to get shot.  
\> even if the RPG isn't aimed well. the airburst can still fuck up your day.  
\> If you don't drop to the ground the moment a bullet whizzes over your head, the next one will probably take your head  
\> IEDs and mortars / RPG's kill more soldiers than gunshots !!  
\> Acting like rambo IRL and shooting two machine guns is likely to get you shot in the face by a sniper or blown up by an RPG to the face  
\> Grenades A.K.A Murder Balls are effective in getting you out of a gunfight, specially if the enemy is in range of your throw, even if they are behind cover.  
\> No people don't catch grenades and toss them back IRL, they run the fuck away and duck behind cover or they die or get their limbs blown off.   
\> People don't assault enemy positions like action heroes after suppressive mortar fire and rack up a dozen kills, IRL soldiers get a position blasted into rubble and only when the gunfire stops from the enemy end and doesn't start up again and you know your enemy is dead, you walk from cover to cover to confirm the kill.  
\> Head on a swivel 24/7 or you are likely to get your face shot off.  
\> Aside from small arms fire, you are definitely not safe in an armored vehicle... 50 Cal, direct mortar strike, Heavy gun emplacements or a direct RPG hit can all seriously fuck up an armored vehicle and everyone inside it.  
\> Smoke grenades can save your life more than HE grenades A.K.A murder balls.  
\> if you see the barrel of an enemy tank homing in on your location, i don't care if you are freaking rambo.. if you don't move the fuck out of the way.. they'll be cleaning you off the wall for the next couple of days.   
\> No you can't walk up to tanks and drop grenades in the hatches, unless the drivers and the gunners are absolute idiots..   
\> running away in an open space dodging gunfire... nope that shit never works out in real life.  
\> Helicopters / Gunships can seriously fuck up your day..."

Is invading Russia really suicide?,44,0.95,coriij,https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/coriij/is_invading_russia_really_suicide/,26,2019-8-11,"Aight, from the onset of history Russia has faced large scale invasions. From the Mongols, to the French, and to the Germans. The road into Russia is fairly flat because of the East European Plain, which allows for armies to advance as rapidly as Russia can retreat. The main reason that Russia has prevailed in several modern wars is because of scorched earth policies, retreating, the winter, and a late winter/early spring counter-offensive. All of which combined force the invaders to stretch their supply lines, become isolated (largest country in the world by area), and ultimately be pushed back.

What if, and I mean this is a THICC what if, that tactic was used against them?

The United States is in a unique position in that we can invade Russia from the East, meaning that if we were to get into a **CONVENTIONAL** Third World War, we could invade, with help from other nations, via both the east and the west.

This means that Russian forces would need to (potentially) retreat in two directions instead of one. So, while the Russians are burning everything and retreating, Allied forces would break up into four attack groups, having two entrenched lines of defense (one east & one west) and the other two would keep the pressure on the Russian forces. The attack groups would rotate, allowing for no stone to be left upturned. All-the-while the combined air forces firebomb farms and industrial centers, crippling the war industry and ability to sustain the population.

&#x200B;

My theory is that the only way to defeat Russia is to lay the entire nation to siege.

Could it work? Like I said, this is incredibly hypothetical.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Aight, this is now edited.

Could an invasion via the Black Sea work in conjunction?

 If no nation can beat Russia through conventional means, (disregarding H-bombs and other nuclear weapons because once one goes off over foreign soil, then SHTF) then in what other ways could Russia be defeated? Cyber warfare is dominated by the Russians and the Chinese, so If we put more money into that, could it help? Sabotage of their economy? If so, how? Feeding the ever-prevalent political instability of Russia (history of authoritarian rulers and coups)?"

But from what I perceive most of those who were in combat in olden days to the conflict in Vietnam leaned on alcohol as a means of ‚Äúdecompression‚Äù from the brutality of war. Why has it fallen out of favour in most western militaries? Yes soldiers drink, but it‚Äôs not provided by their government in rations, soldiers have to go out of their way to obtain liquor. Drinking is a big part of a soldiers life, whether it be a way of building unit cohesion or overcoming the horrors of combat. Why has this fallen out of favour in recent years? I would love to get any resources related to this topic. 

Do you think that the reduction in alcohol use has had an effect on the rates of ptsd among soldiers? I personally think this would be an interesting study to undertake."

What are some battles, texts, recordings that talk about how the dead and wounded affected the battlefield. I can't remember where but I thought I heard that in one of Napoleon's battles, the dead were essentially ran over and crushed to a pulp by the horses riding over top and it got me thinking about this question.

I always thought that the dead and wounded could cause some significant obstructions and slow downs during a battle."

I have read estimates stating that this would be a catastrophe for the Egyptian people as that's there main source of water.
This will lead to massive water loses to drink, their agriculture will collapse and the rest of the economy is likely to crash too. It seems pretty likely that Egypt will have to declare war on Ethiopia as Egypt will be on the brink of collapse.

Just reading about this has made me even more worried for the future. Does anybody else think about any other potential wars breaking out?"

Would archers and swordsmen make a comeback if space warfare became common?,31,0.89,hdufse,https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/hdufse/would_archers_and_swordsmen_make_a_comeback_if/,58,2020-6-22,"Now with Donald Trump announcing plans for a ""Space Force"", this got a lot of people thinking how their equipment and tactics might be changed and evolve. 



Now why would swords and bows come back to the battle field? Well considering how cramped present day submarines and ships are; engagements at long ranges are not going to be as common.  In fact; I predict that with all the tight, short, hallways, and corners to set up an ambush in, a short sword like a cutlass will be more appropriate than a firearm.



Now as for bows; those might be used in much larger ships (if those ever exist) and outside of ships (in the void or on a planet with little to no apmostphere). Now the reason we're using bows instead of firearms is because guns in space are actually a bad idea. 



Without any air to disperse the heat from firing, a gun will just build up heat until it literally melts. Not to mention that unless you place the stock of the rifle on your sternum, the recoil force won't be symmetrical. Therefore, every shot will send you into a ballerina spin. 



Now another thing about guns, or more specifically bullets; is that they tend to puncture things.  Obviously. So if a bullet were to miss and shoot through a more fragile part of the ship hull, that's gonna be bad for everyone on board.


Now before you tell me that this concept is fucking stupid; note that the Soviets actually invented a laser pistol for astronauts because bullets would puncture the hull.

Now besides flashbulb powered lasers; archers are probably a much better solution"

They can't get close enough to targets to launch their aircraft. 

And so I was just thinking. Couldn't the Chinese (or whoever) just mass a couple hundred missile batteries on their coast and launch them all at once at the American (or whoever) fleet? It seems to me like the fleet's air defenses would just get overwhelmed and not be able to shoot them all down. 

In the past like in WW2 these kinds of smart long range missiles didn't exist. But now it seems like a relatively cheap missile could take out a huge expensive ship with thousands of people on it.

I'm guessing in a real war that these ships would end up getting refitted with a bunch of air defense systems like CIWS guns. Like during WW2 when ships were fitted with tons of anti-aircraft guns. Look at how many were on the Yamato lol."

The people hopefully leave peacefully but say they don‚Äôt, say they continue? What is the security forced to do, they have the option to shoot to injure but should they?"

I‚Äôm honestly on the fence about Iran.

I‚Äôm a lifelong student of military history, a huge WWII buff, etc.

I think Trump is a complete moron for how he‚Äôs handled Iran, among many other things. He threw out a flawed, but workable, deal with no contingencies and zero foresight for consequences, and it‚Äôs pretty clear he‚Äôs been goading Iran for a while now.

War is horrible. War is awful. The costs it inflicts on society and the planet are inexcusable, and I‚Äôm never for starting a war unless it‚Äôs absolutely, *absolutely* necessary. By the WWII metric, Iran is far from necessary and would fall somewhere between the spectrum of Vietnam to OEF/OIF in terms of awfulness and stupidity.

That being said, I really don‚Äôt like Iran. I despise them for their continued state sponsorship of terrorism, for their constant efforts to destabilize the region and fuck the US and Israel over, etc. Diplomacy clearly hasn‚Äôt done much since the revolution to change that. And I sure as hell don‚Äôt want them to have nukes given their continued commitment to being shitheads.

But I just don‚Äôt know what to think. I don‚Äôt want a war, like I said, and I don‚Äôt want Trump creating a crisis to boost his popularity. I don‚Äôt want to risk it devolving into some larger clusterfuck conflict, which I think is certainly likely. And while unlikely, I also don‚Äôt want to have to worry about a draft sticking me into a grunt‚Äôs boots before I‚Äôm ready to voluntarily become an officer.

So I don‚Äôt know. Just felt compelled to voice my opinion and try to figure out what the fuck I‚Äôm supposed to think because I‚Äôm sure there are likeminded people here."

So what does everyone make of this?

First, clearly it's the best-named operation in military history. Well done whoever thought it up.

Next what started as a civil war in Yemen with regional powers using the factions as proxies seems to have grown into a genuinely calamitous situation for the Saudis. First the loss of the Aramco oil sites. Now the Houthis are claiming to have killed or captured three brigades.

It turns out proxy warring in a country which is next door, much more densely populated and separated from you only by a very long completely indefensible border is a really bad idea.

So far the media has analysed this in terms of the Houthi successes forcing the Saudis to the negotiating table. Is there a risk of Saudi being conquered? Would the USA step in if that looked likely? And if they did would they be able to come up with a better Operation name?"

There have been many different videos floating around online showing purported executions and war crimes in nagorno karabakh, this is the first one outside sources haven‚Äôt been able to debunk, and may be the first official execution video to come from the war. In it, two Armenian captives are forced to walk against a wall while a man speaking in Russian with a ‚ÄúHeavy Azerbajani‚Äù accent issues then orders, before the words ‚ÄúAim for their heads‚Äù are heard and the two men are executed. 

Armenian officials have already confirmed the identity of the men in the video and the BBC has found several photos comparing the background in the video to that of a town called Hadrut, and has narrowed down the site of the video to ‚Äúthe exact location as the park next to Mkrtchyan Street (39¬∞30'53.4""N 47¬∞02'01.8""E).‚Äù 

Anonymous sources in the Turkish military have reportedly said that the videos were in fact genuine.

The economic incentives of war,25,0.87,b0gptb,https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/b0gptb/the_economic_incentives_of_war/,4,2019-3-13,"War is often compared to a game of chess. But it is not a game of moves and countermoves. And while this is true, to an extent, war has a much deeper benefactor that funds and powers the war. What is that? Economy.

Yeah, yeah, blah blah, nobody cares about economics. This isn't school.

But hold your outdated horses, friends, because if you want to be a tactical thinker, you need to consider what you have in your hands. Have you ever wondered how the U.S. heavily outperformed nations like Great Britain in World War II? What about the Soviet effort to keep fighting, even when their capital neared capture? And Hitler's move to attack the sub-Cacusus regions, was that simply insanity? No. No it was not.

All of these were three factors that lead to a successful war. And most of them relate to economics. I will explain them right now, right here, in a timely matter. Hopefully you will never look at World War II the same way again.

One factor that, hopefully, everybody knows, is money and resources. A country like the U.S., with rich amounts of natural resources and the largest economy to boot will fare much better than Zambia, a struggling nation with little to no resources, and a place you probably have never heard of. It's by the Democratic Republic of The Congo, by the way. Look it up.

Resources are used to finance weapon creation; and money to buy said weapons from foreign nations to support the arms race. It's also good to be developed, so the people have high morale (important later) and so science can do it's thing. The state of the economy is everything in war. Mostly because once a declaration of war is issued, the economy grinds to a halt. And in that situation, you really do not want to be suffering from an economic depression.

Economy runs a war. If there is no economy, there can be no war. A war plan is formulated, not by moving pieces on a map, but by careful planning, estimates on resources, etcetera. This is why Hitler's attack in the Soviet Union failed- because not enough resources were being sent his way to fund the offensive. That's what makes a large empire like the Third Reich difficult to manage. Difficulty in transporting vital materials.

The second factor is morale. Morale within the civilians of a nation is another factor that heavily contributes. If there is a large approval rating, civilians will contribute. War bonds, volunteering positions, even rationing, will occur with a normalized population. At least in a Capitalist nation, or a Democracy.

Civilians make the difference in war. Not soldiers. The people, who make the decisions and can help or not, can distrupt the behavior, and egg on a nation's will to fight, that makes the difference between a success and a failure. It's also why dictatorships usually tend to fail. The dictator falls victim to the will of the people. Civilians hold themselves together. Take World War II, again, as an example. Twice. We all know the Battle of Britain, the largest air force battle in history. When Hitler focused on the civilians, Britian held firm. Every civilian casualty, instead of crippling a nation, strengthened it. That caused Hitler to lose the war. And since the Battle of Britain was won, we continue.

The Soviets are another example. They were very nationalistic. When Hitler invaded, the Soviets, I kid you not, literally picked up their factories and moved them towards the Urals. This allowed the Soviets to survive the Nazi invasion. The people, and their devotion to their country, enabled them to win World War II. And while the soldiers who fought at Stalingrad, as well as on D-Day or every other battle must be respected, and given their fair portion of credit for the victory, the civilians are the unsung heroes that made their soldiers' efforts possible.

There is one more thing. One last thing that follows every war, besides strategy and battlefield vigor. And that is support. Both local and abroad.
World War II, again, was interesting. Most nations leaned towards the Allies, but since the Axis war machine was that dangerous, they didn't dare go against them. One example is Turkey, which was the last buffer zone before the Mediterranean was an Axis sea. Turkey had to submit. But in the end, international pressure, such as from nations in the West, gave the Allies the gut to make D-Day possible. We do need to give a moment to think about the people who brought about the operation, too. It would not have been possible without them.

Today, you see this in action. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in recent American history have been somewhat of a fiasco due to low public support, and remember in Vietnam. American support for that war was low, and also materials were in a shortage, and North Vietnam knew the land. May we all have a moment of silence for all the veterans who were a part of this disastrous war, and respect their dedication to their country.

War is a fickle thing, but you have to remember- it's not a chessboard. It's a checklist."

"Do Warrior cultures that focus on individual fighting lack the basic common sense team work when fighting in the battlefield? AS in Barbarians couldn't even think of something so simple as ""distract a Roman soldier while my friends behead him from behind""?",23,0.88,brpzu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/brpzu4/do_warrior_cultures_that_focus_on_individual/,2,2019-5-22,"An interesting post I found online.

http://lustyvenusianjuuza.deviantart.com/journal/Individual-Fighter-Warrior-Culture-and-Team-Work-581995798

Although the writer focuses on criminal activities and civilian violence, he does have a point.

I mean if drunkards in a bar are able to work together in such coordination that one angry customer pins you down while his drinking buddies are stomping on you.......

It makes me doubt the notion the cultures emphasizing individual fighting EG barbarian tribes who lost to Roman Legions such as the Celts lacked any notion of team work. I can understand the military cultures like the Romans being far superior in their coordination and team-based tactics.

But after reading the link's statements about lower class civilians able to work together in riots-despite typically being individual brawlers in most fights they participated in and lacking ANY TRAINING what so ever- it makes doubt that warrior cultures fought completely as individuals who only knew how to battles as one-on-one duelists.

If civilians like prisoners, angry farmers in a riot, and even some people drinking at a bar could work together to surround you and hit you from blind angles or stomp you on the ground while you try to pin down one of them in a BJJ style move, I find it ridiculous warriors who have the ""individual one-on-one fighter"" mentality wouldn't think of something as simple as ""my friends take on those Spanish conquistadors in a melee to distract them while I sneak behind them and behead them"".

I mean not just many movie but even many history books even describe warrior cultures such as the Mamelukes lacking the common sense to do something as basic as dogphiling a French soldier who was knocked to the ground and stab said French soldier to death.

Which is sounds utter BS to me because guys at bar do such teamwork all the time. Hell even high school jocks (who tend to be egotistic enough to prefer one-on-one fights) can call their friends to surround you should you prove too tough to take on!

So I seriously doubt warriors who fight for a living couldn't think of something as simple as ""Mahican throws stones and spears at colonists to distract them while some other Mahican with tomahawks charge in and hack the distracted demoralized colonist with axes"".

I have no doubt Warrior Cultures and societies emphasizing individual toughness tend to train more as dueling and other individualist style fighting and military based cultures like the Mongols and Germans are far better organized in their teamwork. But to claim warriors only knew to fight as individuals and lack any sense of teamwork is a slap in the face against human nature because even untrained civilians who never been in a fight before could work together to overwhelm a much tougher opponent using basic ""common sense"" teamwork tricks like one guy rearchokes the person while I beat him up."

Hey all, we‚Äôre excited. We‚Äôve been working to produce a podcast about Australian War History. In the first series, we cover the Japanese invasion of Timor during WW2.

The Japanese invasion of Timor is significant because Australian troops overcame all odds and were the first to stop the Japanese juggernaut whilst being massively outgunned and outnumbered. An incredible feat considering the Americans had failed to stop the Japanese thus far.

If the name ""Australian War History"" doesn‚Äôt show up in your particular podcast app. Let me know the app name and I‚Äôll get it added asap. We are updating these all the time.

If you don‚Äôt use podcasts apps, you can listen to it on our website australianwarhistory.com.au

Episodes will be released fortnightly.

How are the Houthis able to keep fighting for so long?,23,0.9,cih09l,https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/cih09l/how_are_the_houthis_able_to_keep_fighting_for_so/,14,2019-7-27,"The Houthis in Yemen have been fighting off the more sophisticatedly armed Saudis, and UAE backed forces for several years now. The Houthis are said to be just a lowly rebel group with no advanced weapons or technology; yet somehow they are able to fend off some of the most advanced and largest militaries in the middle east.

The Houthis are said to be backed by Iran, but no Iranian ships or planes ever land or dock at any Houthi ports or airports. And Iran denies helping the Houthis.

So how do they do it?"

How quarrels between a group of people can even lead to the death and violence for thousands. Let me show you five examples.

**1 - The First Illyrian War (229-228 BC)**

The Adriatic coast was a popular route for Italian, Illyrian and Greek businessmen to sail their ships for the transport of goods across the mediterranean. Piracy was quite common among the Illyrian and many Roman merchants were stolen from and even killed in their voyages. The Roman senate finally sent a delegation to the Illyrians. Their ruler was Queen Teuta and she told the ambassadors that she no government ships will attack Roman ships but she cannot do much about private people stealing in the sea. One of the ambassadors lost his temper and in response, Teuta arranged for the impudent ambassador to be murdered on his way back to Rome. After this happened; Rome declared war.

**2 - M√ºnster Rebellion (1534)**

When Jan van Leiden, an Anabaptist from the Netherlands was informed of the more open minded society in the German town of M√ºnster, he quickly went over there to devote more time and effort to his fate. The town had a bishop and many catholics. Yet seeing how things can be twisted around, him and his anabaptist friend, John Matthys and other anabaptists began spreading propaganda around the town about their particular faith, how the world would soon end, how M√ºnster will be the New Jerusalem and how God is speaking to them. It all seems odd but the fact was that this absurd piece of propaganda was able to give Jan van Leiden and Jan Matthys an army and group of supporters who kicked the authorities and bishop out of the town and started their own regime.

**3 - The Pastry War (1838-1839)**

During the early years of Mexico; a French pastry shop owner had his shop looted by thugs and when he demanded compensation from the government, he got a big no. Afterwards, he appealed to his home country of France to intervene and also gathered together many other French immigrants to do the same. The result was that France demanded Mexico to pay the shop owner and created a blockade on its port; sparking the infamous pastry war.

**4 - World War I (1914-1918)**

When Franz Ferdinand visited the town of Sarajevo, he didn't consider much protection for himself and his wife Sophie. The region was hot with Yugoslav nationalists who hated nothing more than the imperialist Austrian empire and Habsburg rule. After an earlier incident with a hand grenade explosion that harmed some of the Duke's retinue; he still continued things fairly well and paraded in his car for the townspeople. The Duke was quite open and yet the car took a wrong turn, but when the driver went to back out, the breaks locked and at this precise moment, a 19 year old boy, Gavrilo Princip, slipped out and shot point blank the duke and his wife, thus starting a conflict between Serbia and Austria and consequently, the first world war.

**5 - The Albanian Rebellion (1997)**

When a newly formed Albanian government made a ponzi scheme in order to raise money, there came a point when they scheme could no longer make payments and investors got angry. The investors accounted for two-thirds of the population and a particular group of protesters were students from a university in Vlore. The students organized a hunger strike as a protest demanding their returned money and through this they attracted an immense following. Thousands of people surrounded the university and protested with these students attacking police officers and expelling people out of the town. In a month, other Albanian cities and even a Navy base was in control of rebels and the government, failing to control this revolt, gave up and Italy gathered troops with seven other nations to quell the rebellion under a UN resolution.

&#x200B;

What we can learn from this is that wars and historical events are not always created by the hands of kings and generals. In many ways, things can change very dramatically. You can be a mouthy ambassador, a foreign pastry chef, a religious fanatic with a good PR team, a student in a university or even a teenager with a gun and towns and nations can change immensely.

Let us keep this in mind next time we see the news and something spontaneous comes up. Because who knows what it might lead to..."

It has been about 8 years since the incident has happened, so I don't see why Iran couldn't have found a way to at least benefit from it, on the battlefield.

All information is based on real facts and events

On March 29 2019 Brexit occurs, causing an economic crash and immediately sinking the UK's GDP, this crash affects the rest of the world and unrest grows over the coming months. The US companies which have invested $588 Billion in the UK start pressuring the government into raising the US economy and start to expand into China where there is a bigger market. To stop these moves the US pulls troops out of Syria to help ""liberate"" Venezuela (which has more oil than Saudi Arabia). The resulting pullout of the Middle East is considered a brave move by the world, until Syria is invaded by a joint Russo-Chinese attack only a month later. After only 2 weeks of fighting the capital Damascus is taken by the Russians and the invasion is celebrated in Moscow. 

The Kremlin, growing in confidence, announces a joining of governments with Belarus (allowing Putin to stay in power indefinitely) and moves its forces further west. The Russian troops commence a joint attack on The Ukraine from the north in Belarus and the south on the Crimean peninsula, the conflict grows as Ukrainian soldiers and rogue militia rush to west to combat the soldiers. Civil unrest grows leading to riots in New York, Kiev, London and Caracas, while in many cities around the world people protest the invasions.

A month after the invasions of Ukraine Kiev is in turmoil, the Russians and Belarusians sailed down the Dnieper River and landed their troops in the capital, the city is controlled by the Russians but Ukraine loyalists still wage guerrilla warfare throughout the country. Putin now believes he is unstoppable, war crimes are being committed all across the world. The government also funds many groups around the world. The North Koreans are funded by the Kremlin and a bomb is detonated in Seoul, killing the American and British Ambassadors.

Several cities around the world are no longer controlled by the government, Derry is controlled by the Provisional IRA and the British forces have been expelled, starting the reunification of Ireland. Taiwan has claimed independence, Taipei is a war zone, with protests all around the city. The PRC (China) forces cannot send enough troops to control the country and hold Syria so the troops are pulled out as US forces land in the south of the island. Protests in London have caused deaths around the city and parliament has been bombed twice since the 29th of March, people are starving all over the UK and mass migrations have occurred, with millions flocking to the safer economic regions of Europe and Australia. 

A cyber attack shuts down the Colorado power grid leaving millions helpless and causing a breakout at ADX Florence, El Chapo heads for Mexico and the unbomber disappears, most of the other inmates are caught. 

Due to Russia and the US pulling out of the INF treaty, nuclear warheads are placed in Norway and Japan by the Americans, Russia responds by planting missiles in Ecuador and Cuba and China places missiles in the South China Sea and in Brazil.

An unknown terrorist group detonates bombs in St Petersburg, Shanghai and LA, causing greater suspicion around the world. China grows even more suspicious when a radioactive bomb goes off in Jakarta, irradiating the area and halting China's trade with the country.

The war officially starts on August 17th 2019 when Russian troops invade Poland through Belarus, NATO responds and deploys troops to stop the invasion. 

The countries officially at war with Russia are US, Germany, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Turkey and Greece but many more soon join.

China forms an alliance with Russia and the tow countries begin to claim land around the world.

The Australian and Kiwi forces start fighting China in the South China Sea, bombing islands made by the PRC and engaging in aerial and naval warfare, however they are far outmatched and call for reinforcements.

They asked me about my Grandad, who served in the Royal Core of Signals, General Patterns 8th Army, in WW2.

It hit me that this was the first time I'd been asked about my Grandfather since he died recently. I realise that in a way his memory will live on as I tell my friends, kids, and grand kids these stories over the coming years.

Two of his accounts of war stick in my mind more than most.

While driving trucks in the dessert he regularly saw bodies, burnt out tanks and blown up equipment belonging to both sides. He described looking inside a burnt out tank once and seeing brass buttons from uniforms - apparently all that remained of the occupants.

For a period during the War he was assigned to deliver movement orders to forward units by motorcycle. He explained that soldiers running signals on motorbikes were often picked off by enemy snipers or even strafed by enemy aircraft....at one point the average life expectancy was about 20 minutes. He did this particular job for 2 years. I asked him how he survived, he just smiled and said 'I used to ride like bloody hell!'

I miss him."

It's to my understanding that we are in a proxywar and some countries like Russia are strategic allies (right?). But whatever allies they have only support them on terms that they don't start a war. However I feel if Iran launched an attack they'd still have the strategic support. So if this is the case why would we even launch an attack in the first place?

Iran is my biggest fear because I feel it's possible that they have secret nukes, and that means they can't test them if they do so there's no telling where a nuke would land."

What's the problem with giving a warning?  Dropping leaflets warning of impending strikes  to allow evacuation has a long history.  Or some other methods.

Also, according to this [New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/russias-madman-routine-in-syria-may-have-averted-direct-confrontation-with-the-us-for-now-putin-trump), when the U.S., the UK, and France in April 2018 struck Syrian military sites manned by Russian mercenaries in response to Assad's use of chemical weapons,

>...French military officials had in fact warned their Russian counterparts of the impending strikes. In turn, an official close to the Assad regime told Reuters, ‚ÄúWe had an early warning of the strike from the Russians.‚Äù

It doesn't seem like the U.S. had huge issues with France's action.  Why could warnings before a punitive cruise missile attack be issued in the Syrian conflict, but be considered not feasible with the Iranians?"

*  The main reason for Carnatic wars was the rivalry between the French and British which broke out in 1940 as at the time of War of Austrian Succession, Britain and France were on different sides.  
* India was vulnerably exposed to many European nations for trade. **To gain a trade monopoly** in India French and British met at different locations to prove one‚Äôs authority over the other and these incidents by historians are referred to as Carnatic wars.
* Initially, the **common people benefited** from the war as the main reason was the establishment of a trade monopoly in India and competition brought lower values of goods. as a result, a wide range of products was available at reasonable prices. Many Nawabs were asked to make an alliance with either of them but they refused.
* It was not the French who fought or died in the battle. They all were **French trained Indian soldiers who had no reason to fight against the Britishers**. Indians did not even know why they were fighting against each other. The rivalry was between the French and British but it was Indians who suffered the most. 
* **merchants suffered** a lot as now they have to sell similar goods for less due to more competition. This led merchants to figure out something for their benefits and they started adulteration in the products. Moreover, they also started portable vendors in order for more profit. 
* This war provided **Britishers with more land and as well as naval supremacy**. The Britishers emerged as a superpower after the Carnatic wars

If we study both close enough, we‚Äôre likely to see the similarities between why certain things led to success and why others lead to failure.

Lessons from the past wars and happenings can only act like a navigating guide for the present and the future. However, we need to take them as a grain of salt.

Newspapers would have to fuel anti British feelings like the war of 1812. The sinking of the Lusitania had to have never happened. Their would have to be a clash of interests. Germany would probably suspend unrestricted submarine warfare if they see the US entering the war on their side. An incident happens and war breaks out. War with the British started the invasion Canada begins on 4 fronts: East Montreal, Quebec, etc..), Midwest (Ontario and Great Lakes), Central (Winnipeg, etc..), West (Vancouver). British shell cities like New York. Germany almost starved the british with u boats. With our help they would of succeeded. They can resupply on our East Coast. We'd be able to conquer Canada well most of it. Japanese, British, and Australian troops would seize possessions like Hawaii, Philippines, and Mariana Islands. Everything like The Russian revolution would still happen. The Bristish, French would realize that we would shift the power balance and winning the war impossible for them. Treaty of Versailes: it would be more fair. Finland, Poland, Western Ukraine, and the Baltics would be German client states. They would also get Luxemburg and get back their colonies and gain some colonies in Africa. We would get most of Canada with provencies that would probably end up becoming states except Quebec which would get some sort of independence. We also get Bermuda, the Bahamas, some Bristish Caribbean islands, and many Pacific islands including getting back the islands in the Pacific we lost. France would face army restrictions. Italy would have to pay reparations to Austria but would probably not be paid cause the Austrian Hungarian empire would still dissolve.

Japan's Remilitarization,18,0.87,ajrztg,https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/ajrztg/japans_remilitarization/,5,2019-1-26," apan is poised to put its first aircraft carriers to sea since World War II, refitting its Izumo-class warships to carry US-designed F-35B fighter jets, the government announced Tuesday. In its 10-year Defense Program Guidelines, Tokyo said it will buy 42 of the stealthy F-35Bs, which are designed for short-run take offs and vertical landings. Those planes will be available for deployment aboard two flat-top ships, the JS Izumo and JS Kaga, which at more than 800 feet long and displacing 27,000 tons are the largest ships in the Japanese fleet. The new guidelines listed China, North Korea and Russia, as well as the United States and NATO, as entities with massive military capabilities with which Japan must concern itself. The Izumo and Kaga have been carrying helicopters designed for anti-submarine warfare since entering service over the past three years. They will need to have their decks reinforced to accommodate the heavier F-35Bs, as well as the heat and force from the jets' thrusters when they land vertically. Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said the new aircraft carriers would give Tokyo the ability to mount territory defenses farther out from its main islands. ""China's rapid modernization of the People's Liberation Army, enhancement of operational capabilities, and unilateral escalation of activities in areas close to Japan are generating strong security concerns in the region and international community, including Japan,"" the paper said. However Wallace and Schuster both cautioned that the Japanese carriers are small and cannot carry many aircraft -- especially compared to the US Navy's massive 90,000-ton Nimitz-class carriers or even China's 58,000-ton Liaoning carrier. The main assembly point for the F-35 is Fort Worth, Texas, but the jets are also put together in Nagoya, Japan, and Italy. Japanese government officials said all the planes in the new order will be imported."

And finally, Louis-Victor Baillot:

The 105th, placed in the second line, advances successfully, in spite of the deadly fire of the enemy and removes with the bayonet a position held by the English. But, a few moments later, the Scots lying in the wheat rose and fired point-blank at the French, who surprised by this unpredictable attack had to retreat. Pulling together, the men of the 105th, advance again, when suddenly, the formidable Scottish gray dragons launched by Wellington arise. The charge, of a rare violence, cuts whole ranks. Louis Victor receives a violent blow of saber on the head, but thanks to his bowl deposited under his hairstyle, it escapes miraculously to the death. Wounded by a large wound, stunned and covered with blood, he is left for dead on the battlefield. Picked up by the English the next day, he will be taken captive on the pontoons of Plymouth. Released at the end of 1816, he landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer, joined Auxerre on foot, where he was reformed as phtisique the second degree. Driven by his father, repressed by his mother and his brother, afraid to see a ghost arise, he will have to insist for a long time to convince his family that he is alive.

Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.

Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.

G√∂ring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

 In reality, the closest thing would be the Soviets experimenting  with dropping troops into snow without a parachute. 


Even in Sci-fi, the only proposed solutions would be 


A= place troops in metal boxes and drop them from orbit, hoping they don't die (like the drop pods in Halo ODST)


Or B= ""just jump, lol ‚ò∫"" (Like the Skiff in Destiny where troops (in this case the Eliksni) just jump out through side ports of the aircraft while it's still 20ft above ground 


C= teleport out of the aircraft (like the Jump Ship also in Destiny)



All of these are bad ideas as we can't fucking teleport, nor do we have the leg strength to take a 20ft fall and be perfectly fine. And a drop from orbit in a metal coffin does not at all sound fun

So let's hear your ideas. How can we drop off troops from an aircraft without having to land or slow down?"

We talked with experts and soldiers to figure out what they have been up to, where they are operating, and which countries they are likely to pop up in very soon. Was told to post here as well.

For this episode we have  
SEAN MCFATE >> Ex PMC and professor at Georgetown University  
ALEX KIRSCH >> Current US solider (5 tours) and host of Depth of Perspective.  
SAHAR KHAN >> CATO institute and America Pakistan Foundation fellow  
CANDANCE RONDEAUX >> Russia/Wagner Group expert. 

We particularly go over the operations of these groups inside Syria, Iraq, Libya, Venezuela, CAR, Mozambique, Turkey and many more, as well as which countries are likely to see PMC interference in the current months. 

Its designed to be a crash course on everything you need to know about these groups, and learnt a lot making it. 

We also decided to leave it some of the more controversial points this time, including which Russian Oligarchs are directly tied to the war in East Ukraine and the Sahel. 

The show is really starting to pick up and this sub was a huge help in gathering guests and info so I thought I would share it here to say thanks.

Would love your input and feedback as well.

The Russian forces parachuted onto the island of Gogland, which is part of Russia but located roughly 70 miles from Helsinki, from a Mi-8AMTSH helicopter at an altitude of 2,500 meters.Once on the ground, the Russian forces camouflaged their parachutes and headed into the interior of the island to destroy a series of mock communications stations, radars, and ASM batteries.The soldiers who participated in the mock invasion had ""not less than a hundred jumps with parachutes of various types,"" according to the Russian Defense Ministry statement.Honestly in the end of the matter,Russia should meet with NATO to calm them down,after everything thats happening the world doesn't need another nuke-happy man like the dictator of North Korea."
Do you think that Laws for War are... pointless?,15,0.84,91fo42,https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/91fo42/do_you_think_that_laws_for_war_are_pointless/,9,2018-7-24,"Okay, so this has always been a topic I was kinda interested in and intrigued by. I always wanted to discuss about it in some kind of forum and hear other people opinions.

Basically my two sides are in conflict on this. There is the emotional side which says that, well you shouldn't kill harmed soldiers, certain weapons are too extreme, torture should be illegal, civilians should not be targeted etc. I don't know if I could actually kill someone who is defenseless but you never know if you never have been at a real war.

But then there is the logical side. Harmed soldiers might go back to the fight once they recover and kill your people, no weapon is too extreme and stuff like torture can lead to gaining some very precious information. After all it is a full out war, not a fucking playground so, why make rules for things where people lose their lifes in. Why belittle their sacrifice and try to make... I don't know... a nice war? Like do you realize how that sounds? ""Yeah, go ahead and have wars, kill your people, but be sure to play nice""... That is how I understand the laws of war.

And even so, why would you not go for such tactics? They are hideous but honor is not what wins a war. A total victory wins a war, and history is written by the victors. In my country, Poland, plenty of civilians died, people were tortured and enemies took no prisoners. Do you think that Germans would argue with Polish people about how they won the fight in an unhonorable way while they kept my people in prisons? No, they just took over everything. And after the war, nazis were prosecuted for their crimes but what of it if they still won the fight? What if Germany won the WWII? It would be the Allies who would be prosectued for no reason. As I said it seems like no matter how, a win is still a win, history is written by the victors, and war is the place were the strong survive and weak die. Strong people who have balls to make tactical decisions, not based on human emotions.

The same with nuclear bomb. Through testing Americans were aware of its power and they used it anyway. Hiroshima and Nagasaki became devastated and areas were polluted. It killed civilians as well as soldiers but what of it? American soldiers were saved by making Japan surrender. America pulled out a total victory with its new weapon. A weapon that was way too extreme to be used. And no one is arguing about it right now. No one sees is it as a war crime. Even though plenty of civilians died. Maybe because it is the Allies who were the victors, and as I said history is written by those who win.

I believe that the laws for war were created just to protect our morality in some way. Just to make sure that we have something against immoral doings during the wars. After all, such things are commited anyway. Wasn't somewhere around 2015 that it was discovered that CIA/US army was torturing terrorists? You would think that US is a country that would lead in such things as laws for war crimes and yet, the country broke those rules ifself. Why? US is constantly at a freaking war with terrorists. And if by torturing some Abdul from Middle East you can protect your own people, so be it."

Battle for Sadr City,14,0.86,1ldvip,https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/1ldvip/battle_for_sadr_city/,3,2013-8-30,"In the Spring of 2008, Coalition forces were tasked to build a wall in Sadr City Baghdad to keep the Mahdi Militia from firing rockets into the green zone. This battle took place from March-October of 2008, involved more than 8 batallion size elements, Navy Special Warfare units, and other OGA's. Currently, two books have been written about the battle. The first book, Angels in Sadr City, can be found on Facebook as it is nearing its 2nd Edition release. The site for this is 
https://www.facebook.com/pages/Angels-In-Sadr-City-The-Final-Battle-for-Baghdad-Iraq/284430356385

The second book, Stryker: the siege of Sadr city, was a successful book launched by Konrad Kjos in 2012. There is now a press to complete an anthology, which tells the entire story of the battle with everyone involved. It is believed by many on the ground that Chris Kyle, a Navy Seal Sniper, was out in Baghdad during this time, fighting along side the Army as they made their way through this battle. I encourage all to visit the link posted on Facebook. Or simply go to facebook and in the search block type in ""Angels in Sadr City."" The book is scheduled to be released around November of this year.

On the morning of December 12, 1942, the German army group ""Goth"" launched an offensive. Operation ""Winter storm"" has begun.

The enemy began to operate from the Kotelnikovo area, in a general direction to the northeast, the main blow was delivered by the enemy on a narrow section of the front along the Tikhoretsk-Stalingrad railroad. Here came the 6th and 23rd enemy tank divisions of the 57th Panzer Corps, opposed by our 302nd and 126th Infantry Divisions of the 51st Army. Cavalry and infantry German-fascist troops operated on the flanks of the tank divisions. The commanders were sure that south-west of the station. Tundutovo they will be able to connect with the Paulus grouping.

The enemy began with a powerful artillery preparation, which enabled him to break through

Defense in the lane of the 302nd Infantry Division at the Kurmojarsky semi-station. The soldiers of this division are stubbornly resisting. But the enemy had a great superiority in tanks and aircraft. This ensured the success of the operation.

Under these conditions, the commander of the Stalingrad Front, Colonel-General AI Eremenko, demands that the commander of the 51st Army keep the line occupied by his troops and restore the situation in the sector of the 302nd Infantry Division. The 235th Flamethrower Tank Brigade and the 87th Rifle Division are sent from the reserve of the front to help the 51st Army.

At the same time, the commander of the 5th Shock Army, Lieutenant-General M. M. Popov, is ordered to speed up the concentration of the army's troops for an offensive in the Rychkovsky area in order to eliminate the German bridgehead there.

In the afternoon of December 12, the divisional panzer divisions seek to reach the Aksai Esaulovsky river and seize the bridgeheads on its right bank. Soviet soldiers are bravely defending their positions.

With the onset of darkness, the advanced units of the 6th German Panzer Division manage to reach certain areas to the southern bank of the river. Aksai, and the 23rd Panzer Division - to the area north of Nebykov. Parts of the 302nd Infantry Division went to the Chilekov-Nebykov line-the Ternovy state farm. After mastering Gremyachy and traveling 161 km, the Germans tried to reach the flank and rear of the 126th Infantry Division and pressed her right flank regiment, but were stopped.

So begins the defensive-offensive Kotelnikovo operation of the troops of the Stalingrad Front, which will end only on December 30.

Again, every Soviet soldier understands that one must hold out to the approach of reserves at all costs, and not let the advancing enemy come together with the surrounded group. For our troops, as in the days of the heroic defense of Stalingrad, an order sounds: ""Not a step back!"".

Soviet soldiers heroically executed this order. On December 12, 1942, Lieutenant-Colonel Mikhail Diasamidze was particularly distinguished. With his regiment he skillfully organized the defense of an important district in the village. Verhnekumsky. Within five days, the personnel of the infantry regiment repelled 30 attacks of large infantry and enemy tanks. With a personal example, Diasamidze encouraged the fighters to take decisive action to defend an important area, he was wounded, but he did not leave the battlefield until the task was accomplished.

By decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of December 22, 1942, for exemplary fulfillment of combat missions of the command on the front against the German invaders, and shown with courage and heroism, Mikhail Stepanovich Diasamidze was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union."

&#x200B;

Early morning, 8:00 AM today (Thursday), American soldiers battle the Islamic State to push them away from protected farmland in Fallujah. In the last four months, angry farmers and civilians have reported suspicious and unusual activity from malicious Islamic soldiers on private property.

Abu Ghaffar told press earlier today, ""*It's not unusual to see Islamic soldiers crossing our properties. The only issue we have is when they cause damage to the land or property, including the sheep and goats. We originally tried putting up general static defenses to protect the property, yet the fences, barbed wire posts, signs, and manure failed to stop them.*""

After the American forces had pushed back the militants far enough they began to scatter and head towards the city mid-battle, forcing American troops to clear Kibbeh shops. Many angry shop owners complained to the commanding officers about not taking shoes off before entering the Kibbeh restaurants.

One shop owner had this to say, ""*They would just come in and leave mud and dirt all over the floor. I angrily pointed to the wall, riddled with bullets, and the commanding officer had the audacity to point out that the damage from bullets was there previously, embarrassing our Egyptian patrons who sometimes get into heated arguments during poker, resulting in some light physical violence.*""

Once the sun reached high in the sky, right at 11:30 AM, the Islamic forces retreated and some of them surrendered. With American troops patrolling the rest of the streets surrounding and within the cities, ISIS may take long periods of time to plan their next attack.

But I think it‚Äôs definitely more complicated than that. I think that the war ended so quickly simply because the man had no strong allies, his family fled, and his actual ability as a general was ridiculous. 

Here you have a man, panic stricken, begging the Africans to send their child soldiers so he can have some mercenaries for his forces. I don‚Äôt know why he just didn‚Äôt try to contact the Persians and have them send their men. 
I remember that he did strike up a nice friendship with Berlusconi and Sarkozy, but I think those two men had to give up their friendship with him because of the mounting EU and NATO pressure. 

Nevertheless, Iran and Russia currently support Assad. Where were they when Gaddafi was having his issues? Where were they when in Egypt was engulfed in civil war? 

I think that he could‚Äôve kept his seat through good diplomacy. He went pretty crazy at his later years and I am surprised he didn‚Äôt try to unite himself more with the Saudis or at least with the Persians when things started to look iffy in his country."

My first question is; during WW1, apparently a (popular?) tactic was bombing the enemy trenches for up to days on end, and then sending in waves of men until the trench was captured/they lost too many and stopped. So my question is, was this an actual tactic used? Or was it just something that happened a couple times during the war? (I‚Äôm not very knowledgeable of WW1 so sorry if it‚Äôs a stupid question)

And my second question; would this be viable today? I‚Äôm mostly referring to the artillery part, as I do not think charging tactics like that would work today. Is it too expensive to use all of these shells? WOULD charging enemy positions work nowadays? Do most armies still use artillery?

How would you best achieve victory or at best a stalemate in this scenario with the given resources?,13,0.94,anrs71,https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/anrs71/how_would_you_best_achieve_victory_or_at_best_a/,10,2019-2-6," 

I need help designing/orchestrating the most crucial five-day engagement of my story's war so far.  All help is insanely appreciated.  

&#x200B;

Heres the stage, the current tech era is the 1970s-1980s with a modernish setting with a world war actively raging.  Your current objective is to hold the Wesner Pass from advancing enemy forces at all costs to defend the vital railway city of Fowler which sits one hundred and seventy miles to your southwest. The terrain you will be fighting in for the five days ahead will consist mostly of thick snowy forests with a few clearings in a highly mountainous region. Dirt roads are the most advanced form of local infrastructure in the area along with a few scattered steel bridges that allow for quick traversal of rivers. The civilian population has already evacuated months prior. It will snow at least ten inches over the span of the next eight days.

&#x200B;

Resources along with background: Your forces are tired from the nearly nonstop movement for the past five days; you have a somewhat understrength Infantry Battalion along with a roughly equally understrength Armored Battalion with each averaging around 70-80% combat effectiveness. Supplies (Ammunition/Medical/Food/Parts),  in general, are on the low side as you have been fighting a staggered on and off retreat for nearly a week prior. You have access to nearly any piece of equipment within said era to a reasonable amount (You can decide the overall structure of the two units but please no 100% of the Armored unit is just tanks) with the only constant lack being in Anti Aircraft weapons(Stingers etc.). You have no support other than conventional auxiliary howitzers and mortars. Logistics is nonexistent due to enemy air superiority.  


Your enemy: You are fighting six full-strength battalions of somewhat inexperienced soldiers with two Armored Battalions and for Motorized Infantry Battalions. The enemy possesses complete air dominance but no means to launch a large scale air campaign in the region due to constraints with other ongoing offensives elsewhere. Their overall equipment usage mirrors conventional Soviet Union style units if you wish to know what you are dealing with. Enemy tactics are roughly similar to late Cold War Soviet-era tactics. They possess three squadrons of Hind Helicopter gunships for fire support along with recon or transport options which can prove to be a challenge for standard infantry to deal with alone. Their current objective is to make it through the major Wesner Pass to push on and capture the rail hub city of Fowler. Also, like you, they don't have quick access to reinforcements but do have a decent supply chain.

&#x200B;

 Constants: Enemy forces do not expect you to make a stand in the mountains due to your prior constant state of retreat. The opposing force will attempt to break through the major choke point in the center of the mountain range due to their vehicles with the lack of easily traversable terrain. Your relief force comprising of four mechanized infantry battalions and three armored battalions will arrive by sunrise on the fifth day no matter what. Your tanks are outdated by at least five years in comparison to what you are facing so they will not last long in a slugging match against enemy MBTs. Unlike the somewhat inexperienced enemy force who had been winning on pure momentum, your men are quite experienced in comparison(Use or interpret this how you wish). Expect enemy forces to adapt and plan around ahead as you develop your strategy to survive the next few days while taking in your current supply deficit into account(Just be reasonable).  


  
Objective: Win or achieve a stalemate at ANY or ALL costs that allows you to hold your objective until the 5th day. 

Any and all options or strategies with your current resources are open. 

Good luck and God speed, Commanders."

I personally think that Infantry units are becoming Obsolete, with the rise in missile, artillery, and aircraft. I do realize that Infantry is needed to combat insurgency and control a population but is such large infantry forces needed. I feel like the money and resources would be better spent on intelligence and  strike technology. 

Anyway, I would like your thoughts and I hope to start a discussion! "

What is the point of tanks exactly? They are basically moving steel coffins that has several weak points that can be exploited. You can immobilize a tank, you can easily destroy a tank with RPG(which basically makes reactive armor useless), in urban warfare, you can destroy tanks from multiple positions in multiple ways.

I can see why tanks were useful in World War 1 and partially in World War 2, but nowadays, there's just too much ways of dealing with a tank, where I go back to my question, why are we still using them?(other then it protects you from small fire)"

The next generation of lasers will make shooting down enemy missiles and fighters even easier.  Drones can also be used to fly recon.  Drones can also land on carriers easier then people can.  Especially in bad weather.  So I think eventually fighter pilots will be obsolete.

It‚Äôs not completely unreasonable. Though tensions have calmed, we have to remember that not too long ago Chinese and Russian forces fought border skirmishes. I would like to look into an alternate history where the border conflict continues to modern times and war breaks out. My thought is I give this one to Russia. We‚Äôre going to assume no nuclear weapons are used bc China knows they can‚Äôt win that and Russia would likely not want to strike first. I know China has the manpower advantage, but we have to remember that those are all soldiers who would need to be armed, trained, transported, etc. and China lags behind Russia in military manufacturing capability. Not to mention how much more Capable Russia is when it comes to developing advanced weapons. Next my focus will be weapons. Russia has a massive stockpile and likely would be reinforced by Countries like the US. These weapons are comparable if not superior to those in the possession of China. I have to give the advantage to Russia. Also geography is important and Russia has control of oil and the ability to pressure middle eastern nations into cutting ties with China. Again advantage is Russia. In my opinion I think this one is close. China is such a massive nation with incredible industrial capabilities, but that all draws on resources that will likely be cut off or destroyed by Russia. I think the result would be a war much like the First World War, with China launching human wave attacks at superior Russian forces until their resources run dry or the people revolt.

I have decided to ask this question today for several reasons. Firstly, with all the political unrest and the divide between governments and their people, it looks like people have had enough with the way the worlds run. Secondly, it seems that people are now developing a clear two sides of what they stand for in today‚Äôs world and it‚Äôs getting violent. As well as that, people are now becoming speculative about what they‚Äôve been told and it‚Äôs causing unrest. Lastly, it looks like that tension between different peoples have stirred for too long and it‚Äôs at its boiling point.

Some may ask where I‚Äôm getting all of this from. All you have to do is look at any form of media, Facebook to YouTube, Reddit. People‚Äôs inner hate, with the ability of the internet, is now showing peoples true colours and to be quite frankly it‚Äôs scary and it only takes the average person to realise this can‚Äôt keep going like this and at some point somthings going to happen, like we‚Äôve never seen before. To add note, I am a younger generation so it might be easier for me to see, but old enough to realise we are in an ever growing world of hate and resent for others which differ in what we believe.

This is more of an ask post so if anyone would like to comment to show and enlighten me on their view and how they see this. It would be really interesting for me to develop my understanding of others opinions. Thanks for the time to read and have a great day."
Trump's upcoming war on Iran - A complete analysis,14,0.77,8b0z0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/8b0z0z/trumps_upcoming_war_on_iran_a_complete_analysis/,19,2018-4-10,"One of the most frustrating tasks is to try to debunk the Hollywood myths imprinted on the mind of Americans about warfare in general and about special forces and technology in particular. There is vast difference between  ‚Äúthe American way of war‚Äù as seen in propaganda movies and the reality of warfare.




*Clich√© No 1: the US military has a huge conventional advantage over Iran: *



In warfare what matters is not the size of your military, but how much of it is¬†actually available¬†for combat in the theater of military operations TMO (conflict area).For example, if in any one given TMO you have only 2 airfields each capable of sustaining air operations for, say 100 aircraft, it will do you no good to have 1000 aircraft available.¬† You might have heard the sentence ‚Äúcivilians focus on firepower, soldiers on logistics‚Äú.¬† This is true.¬† Modern military forces are extremely ‚Äúsupport heavy‚Äù meaning that for one tank, aircraft or artillery piece you need a huge and sophisticated support line making it possible for the tank, aircraft or artillery piece to operate in a normal way.¬† Simply put ‚Äì if you tank is out of fuel or spares ‚Äì it stops.¬†



 So it makes absolutely no sense to say, for example, that the USA has 13‚Äô000 aircraft and Iran only 500. This might well be true, but it is also irrelevant.¬† What matters is only how many aircraft the US and NATO could have ready to engage on the moment of the initiation of combat operations and what their mission would be.¬†The reality is that the USA would need many months to assemble near Iran.¬† And the reality also is that nothing could force the Iranians to just sit and watch while such a force is being assembled (the biggest mistake Saddam Hussein made).




*Clich√© No 2: high technology wins the day-*



That is a fantastically false statement and yet this myth is sacred dogma amongst civilians, especially in the USA.¬† In the real world, high teach weapons systems, while very valuable, also come with a long list of problems the first one of which is simply cost. Technology is also typically fragile and requires a very complex support, maintenance and repair network.Take, for example, an armed drone.¬† It can be defeated by:



1.shooting it out of the sky (active defense)




2.blinding or otherwise disabling its sensors (active defense)




3.jamming its communications with the operator (active defense)




4.jamming or disabling its navigation system (active defense)




5.camouflage/deception (passive defense)




6.providing it with false targets (passive defense)




7.protecting targets by, for example,¬†burying them (passive defense)




8.remaining mobile and/or decentralized and/or redundant (passive defense)




There are many more possible measures, it all depends on the actual threat.¬†¬†Finally, history has shown over and over again that willpower is far more important that technology.¬† Just look at the absolutely humiliating and total defeat of the multi-billion high tech Israeli Defense Forces by Hezbollah in 2006.¬† The Israelis used their entire air force, a good part of their navy, their very large artillery, their newest tanks and they were defeated, horribly defeated, by probably about less than 2000 Hezbollah fighters, and even those where not the very best Hezbollah had (Hezbollah kept the best ones north of the Litani river).¬†¬†




*Clich√© No 3: big military alliances help win wars*



In WW2, the Red Army accounted for no less than 80% of all the German losses (in manpower and equipment) during the war.¬† All the others, including the USA and the UK, shared the puny 20% or less and joined the war when Hitler was already clearly defeated.¬† Some will mention the various resistance movements which did resist the Nazis, often heroically.¬† I don‚Äôt deny their valor and contribution, but it is important to realize that no resistance movement in Europe ever defeated a single German Wehrmacht or SS division (10 to 15 thousand men).¬† In comparison, in Stalingrad alone the Germans lost 400‚Äô000 soldiers, the Romanians 200‚Äô000, the Italians 130‚Äô000, and the Hungarians 120,000 for a total loss of 850‚Äô000 soldiers.¬† In the Kursk battle the Soviets defeated 50 German divisions counting about 900‚Äô000 soldiers.



Now let‚Äôs turn to the issue of a possible war between Iran and the United States.




The dumbest possible thing to evaluate the possible outcomes of a US attack on Iran would be to do compare all the technologies available to both countries and come to some kind of conclusion.




Generally, the obsession with technology is a typical American pathology which is a direct result of fighting overseas wars against vastly out-gunned enemies. I call that the engineer‚Äôs view of war, as opposed to the soldier‚Äôs view. That is not to say that technology does not matter, it does, but tactics, operations and strategy matter a whole lot more. For example, while it is true that a modern M1A2 Abrams is vastly superior to an old Soviet T-55, there are circumstances (high mountains, forests) where the T-55, properly engaged, could be a much better tank. Likewise, putatively outdated WWII anti-tank guns can be used with devastating effect on modern APC just as outdated air defense guns can by turned into absolutely terrifying assault fire support vehicles.




In the case of the US attack on Iran, only a total ignoramus would suppose that as soon as the Iranians detect the US attack they would scramble their mostly dated air force to try to achieve air superiority or that they would hope to stop the US attack using their air-defenses.  Hezbollah made exactly zero use of their air defenses (only MANPADS anyway) during the Israeli attack on Lebanon in 2006 and that did not prevent Hezbollah from inflicting upon the IDF the most crushing defeat in their history. Why?




Because generally the American way of war doesn‚Äôt really work. What do I mean by ‚ÄúAmerican way of war‚Äù? Using airstrikes and missile attacks to degrade the enemy‚Äôs capabilities to such a degree that it forces him to surrender. This was tried against the Serbian military in Kosovo and resulted in an abject failure: the Serbian forces survived the 78 days of massive NATO bombing completely unscathed (a few MBTs and APCs were lost, that‚Äôs about it). When that failure became apparent to the NATO commanders they did what the US military always does and turned against the civilian Serbian population in retaliation (same as the Israelis in Lebanon, of course) while offering Milosevic a deal: you surrender and we leave you in power. He accepted and ordered the Serbian military out of Kosovo. This was a spectacular political success for NATO, but in purely military terms, this was a disaster (well-concealed from the western public opinion courtesy of the best propaganda machine in history).




What Iranians, and Hezbollah, perfectly understood is that the key to prevail against the USA is to deny them the American way of war and to impose them a type of warfare they absolutely loathe.Here are a few of its key components:




1)¬†*Assume that the American will establish air supremacy¬†in 24 hours or less and deny them any lucrative targets.* Sounds simple, but it is not. This requires a number of steps which can take years to implement including, but not limited to, concealing, hardening and deeply burying the most valuable civilian and military assets, creating an highly redundant network of communication and prepare for semi-autonomous operations when communications fail, creating a country-wide system of local civilian-military cooperation aimed at the survivability of essential government services including law and order, have procedures in place to compensate for the disruption of energy distribution and the destruction of key transportation nodes, etc.  but I would assume that over the past 30 years the Iranians have dug thousands of miles of underground tunnels and command posts which allows the country to literally ‚Äúgo under‚Äù for as long as is needed.




2)¬†*Develop a number of key advanced technologies* such as GPS-spoofing, computer network penetration and disruption, electronic counter-measures warfare, advanced mine warfare, small boat operations and, of course, missile strikes not to deny the US forces any portion of the Iranian territory, but to dramatically increase the risks and costs of US operations. This is were a limited number of advanced air defense systems can make a critical difference, especially if successfully concealed.




3)¬†*Engage in ‚Äúhorizontal escalation‚Äù*: rather than wasting efforts in trying to shoot down US aircraft, use missile strikes to destroy US airfields (and ports) in the region. That is, by the way,¬†official Iranian doctrine. Or strike at US forces in Iraq or Afghanistan. Target Israel or, even better, the Saudi regime. Force the US Navy to either engage in brown-water or, at most, green-water operations (here the Russian Kilo-class subs will excel) or force them to move back and shut down the Strait of Hormuz (the US Navy hates brown and green water operations, and for good reason, the USN is a blue-water navy¬†par excellence) and the Americans are acutely aware of what happened to the US-built Israeli Sa‚Äôar 5-class corvette when it got hit by Hezbollah fired Chinese-built C-802 missile.





4)¬†*Play the time card*: time is always against the US military as the expectation is a short, easy war, with as little as casualties as possible and then a quick ‚Äúout‚Äù. The Israelis ran out of steam in 33 days, NATO in 78 ‚Äì so plan for at least a 12 month long conflict. Western forces have no staying power, let them hope for a ‚Äúquickie‚Äù and then see how they react when it ain‚Äôt happening.




5)¬†Use the traditional American sense of superiority¬†and condescension for ‚Äúsand niggers‚Äùor ‚Äúhajis‚Äù and don‚Äôt bother trying to intimidate them. Instead, try to use that racist mindset to make them commit crucial strategic mistakes as Iran did when it used fake Iraqi ‚Äúdefectors‚Äù who spread disinformation about non-existing Iraqi WMDs to convince the US Neocons to lobby for an attack on Iraq to protect Israel. I find the notion of using US Neocons to make the US get rid of Saddam Hussein and basically hand over Iraq to Iran nothing short of pure genius. This is, of course, why it is never mentioned in western sources :-)





6)¬†*Force the Americans to present you more targets:* the more US forces are deployed near Iran, the more targets they offer for Iranian counter-attacks and the more they get politically bogged-down.We can expect the Iranians to come up with a much longer and far more creative list.




7) *Terrain:* The topography of Iran consists of rugged, mountainous rims surrounding high interior basins. Small villages and *a lot* of deep, underground tunnels.In military terms this all translates into one simple and absolutely terrifying word: infantry.



Why should the word infantry scare so much? Because infantry means on foot (or horses) with very little airpower (AA and MANPADS), satellites (can‚Äôt see much), armor (can‚Äôt move around), gunships, submarines or cruise missiles can do.¬† Because infantry means ‚Äúno lucrative targets‚Äù but small, dispersed and very well hidden forces.¬† Company and even platoon-level warfare.¬† Because infantry in mixed terrains means the kind of warfare the US Americans fear most.



8) *Geopolitics:*



Furthermore, in the 1950s the total US control over the mass media, at least in the so-called ‚Äúfree world‚Äù made it relatively easy to hide out the murderous rampage by US-lead forces, something completely impossible nowadays.¬† The modern reality is that irrespective of the actual military outcome on the ground, any US attack on the Iran would result is such a massive loss of face for the USA that it would probably mark the end of the US presence in Middle East and a massive international financial shock because of rapid hike in oil prices probably resulting in a crash of the currently already fragile US economy.¬† In contrast, China would come out as the big winner and the uncontested Asian superpower.




Finally, just as China cannot allow the USA to crush Iran, Russia cannot allow the USA to crush China.¬† Does that dynamic sound familiar?¬† It should as it is similar to what we have been observing in the Middle-East recently:



Russia and China->Iran->Hezbollah->Syria




This is a very flexible and effective force posture where the smallest element is at the forefront of the line-up and the most powerful one most removed and at the back because it forces the other side to primarily focus on that frontline adversary while maximizing the risks of any possibly success because that success is likely to draw in the next, bigger and more powerful adversary.





So does that mean that Iran would come unscathed from a US attack? Absolutely not. What I expect the Americans to do is what they have always done: engage in the mass murder of civilians in retaliation for their military failures. I know that this will, yet again offendsome¬†doubleplusgoodthinkingpatriots, but massacring civilians is an American tradition dating from the very foundation of the United States. Anybody doubting that ought to read the superb book by John Grenier (USAF Ret.) entitled ‚ÄúThe First Way of War 1607-1814: American War Making on the Frontier‚Äù which explains in exquisite detail how the US anti-civilian terror operations doctrine was developed over the centuries. 




This is, of course, what the Anglos did during WWII when they engaged in mass bombings of German cities to ‚Äúbreak their spirit of resistance‚Äù. And this is what they did in Iraq and Serbia and what the Israelis did in Lebanon. And this is exactly what we should expect will happen in Iran. At least, this is the worst case scenario.




But make no mistake, since neither one of these options would result in anything remotely resembling a victory (this is a political concept defining an achieved political objective) one would have to conclude that both of these options would result in failure and defeat. Such an attack would also seal the end of the US political role in the Middle-East unless, of course, being a despised elephant in a porcelain store is considered a ‚Äúrole‚Äù. 




even if the Iranian casualty figures go in the hundred of thousands, or even over a million like in Iraq, the Iranians will not surrender and they will prevail. For one thing, terrorizing civilians has never worked. Genocide can be a much more viable option, but there are too many Iranians to do that and they are too well dug-in in their country to contemplate such an option (sorry, Israelis, even nuking Iran will not result in a ‚Äúvictory‚Äù of any kind).¬†



So what better way is there for me to end this discussion than by adding religion to the mix?¬†Most Iranian are Shia, that is well known. But what is less well-known is one of the key motto‚Äôs of the Shia which, I believe, beautifully expresses one of the key features of the Shia ethos, is: ‚ÄúEvery day is Ashura and every land is Karbala‚Äù. It basically expresses the willingness to die for the truth at any time and in any place. Millions of Iranians, even those not necessarily very pious, have been raised with this determination to fight and resist, at any cost. And now think of Donald Trump or General ‚ÄúMad Dog‚Äù Mattis and try to imagine how hollow and grotesque they and their threats look to their Iranian counterparts."

I just wanted to add that I am 14, as war questions can get out of hand . So just ignore some of my ignorance, as I dont know too much. Howevrer, I am very curious. To me, it seems like there is no possible way ISIS can win or succeed in what they are doing, as it seems that the whole world (exaggeration) is against them. Thoughts on this? Thanks.

Edit-Wow, I have been extremely worried that this would blow up in the wrong way but so far these responses are nice, thank you!"
