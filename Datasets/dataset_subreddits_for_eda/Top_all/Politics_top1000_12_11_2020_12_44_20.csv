Megathread: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Dies at 87,74525,0.92,ivhbrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ivhbrj/megathread_supreme_court_justice_ruth_bader/,37318,2020-9-19,"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal, cultural, and feminist icon has died. The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from cancer.
Architect of the legal fight for women’s rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation’s highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.

Lawyers for Mr. Trump were expected to appeal the ruling from Judge Victor Marrero of Manhattan federal court. The president’s could not immediately be reached for comment.

In a 75-page ruling, Judge Marrero said called president’s argument ""repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values."" Presidents, their families and businesses are not above the law, the judge ruled.

In response, the President's lawyers filed an emergency notice of appeal to the 2nd circuit. 


## UPDATE:

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has granted Donald Trump a temporary administrative stay pending expedited review by a panel of the Court.

"Susan Collins has failed the people of Maine and this country. She has voted to confirm Trump’s judicial nominees, approve tax cuts for the rich, and has repeatedly chosen to put party before people. I am running to send her packing. I’m Betsy Sweet, and I am running for U.S. Senate in Maine. AMA.",71850,0.81,eizr6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/eizr6l/susan_collins_has_failed_the_people_of_maine_and/,2420,2020-1-2,"Thank you so much for your thoughtful questions! As usual, I would always rather stay and spend my time connecting with you here, however, my campaign manager is telling me it's time to do other things. Please check out my website and social media pages, I look forward to talking with you there!

I am a life-long activist, political organizer, small business owner and mother living in Hallowell, Maine. I am a progressive Democrat running for U.S. Senate, seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Susan Collins. 

Mainers and all Americans deserve leaders who will put people before party and profit. I am not taking a dime of corporate or dark money during this campaign. I will be beholden to you. 

I support a Green New Deal, Medicare for All and eliminating student debt. 

As the granddaughter of a lobsterman, the daughter of a middle school math teacher and a foodservice manager, and a single mom of three, I know the challenges of working-class Mainers firsthand.

I also have more professional experience than any other candidate in this Democratic primary. 

I helped create the first Clean Elections System in the country right here in Maine because I saw the corrupting influence of money in politics and policymaking and decided to do something about it. I ran as a Clean Elections candidate for governor in 2018 -- the only Democratic candidate in the race to do so. I have pledged to refuse all corporate PAC and dirty money in this race, and I fuel my campaign with small-dollar donations and a growing grassroots network of everyday Mainers. 

My nearly 40 years of advocacy accomplishments include:

* Writing and helping pass the first Family Medical Leave Act in the country

* Creating the first Clean Elections system in the country

* Working on every Maine State Budget for 37 years

* Serving as executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby

* Serving as program coordinator for the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom

* Serving as Commissioner for Women under Governors Brennan and McKernan

* Co-founding the Maine Center for Economic Policy and the Dirigo Alliance
Founding and running my own small advocacy business, Moose Ridge Associates.

* Co-founding the Civil Rights Team Project, an anti-bullying program currently taught in 400 schools across the state. 

* I am also a trainer of sexual harassment prevention for businesses, agencies and schools. 

I am proud to have the endorsements of Justice Democrats, Brand New Congress, Democracy For America, Progressive Democrats for America, Women for Justice - Northeast, Blue America and Forward Thinking Democracy.

Megathread: President Donald Trump Removes Watchdog Overseeing Rollout of $2 Trillion Coronavirus Bill,69258,0.9,fwp42m,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fwp42m/megathread_president_donald_trump_removes/,8597,2020-4-8,"President Trump on Monday replaced the Pentagon's acting Inspector General Glenn Fine, who had been selected to chair the panel overseeing the rollout of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed last month, Politico first reported.

 A group of independent federal watchdogs selected Fine to lead the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, but Fine's removal from his Pentagon job prevents him from being able to serve in that position — since the law only allows sitting inspectors general to fill the role.

The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20 inauguration.

Any such move would require a change of federal law, meaning it would need to go through Democrats in the House of Representatives in addition to the Republican-controlled Senate. (The Congressional Research Service actually weighed in on this topic in March, specifically noting that a president has no legal authority to change the date of the election.)

The President has narrow, limited authority to withhold appropriations under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. OMB told GAO that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent ""in a manner that could conflict with the President’s foreign policy."" The law does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons.

"I’m Jaime Harrison, the ""Democratic Challenger"" to Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina. I’m running for Senate to bring hope back to the working families of SC and to #SendLindseyHome. AMA!",64524,0.86,goow8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/goow8f/im_jaime_harrison_the_democratic_challenger_to/,1404,2020-5-23,"Follow us here: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harrisonjaime) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JaimeHarrisonSC) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harrisonjaime/)

Hey Reddit, thanks for having me! 

I grew up in Orangeburg, SC. I was the son of a single mom and learned to read from comic books. My grandparents helped raise me. They didn’t have a lot, but they taught me the important stuff: that hard work and character, matter.

I earned a scholarship to Yale University, and eventually Georgetown Law. I came back to South Carolina to teach 9th grade social studies before I went to work for Congressman Jim Clyburn. During my time in his office, I was the first African-American Executive Director of the House Democratic Caucus and Floor Manager for the House Majority Whip, which Rep. Clyburn became when the Democrats took control of the House in 2006.

I served as the first African-American Chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party before deciding to run for Senate. My most important job, though, is that I’m now raising my two boys with my wife, Marie, in Columbia, SC. 

The American Dream is alive and well for some, but not all Americans. Here in South Carolina, rural hospitals are closing, schools are underfunded, roads are crumbling, and our coasts are threatened by offshore drilling. We need a Senator who’s fighting to improve the lives of South Carolinians rather than focusing on interests in Washington D.C.

I’m running for Senate to fight for opportunity for all South Carolinians. I know that when your community needs help, political party affiliations don’t matter.

Ask me anything about my campaign, how Lindsey Graham has forgotten the people of South Carolina and our country, or baking (one of my favorite hobbies, especially during quarantine)! I'll be on around 3 PM EST to answer your questions.

Proof:  https://i.redd.it/36idpf4877051.jpg

EDIT: This was a lot of fun, y’all! Thanks for the great questions. Definitely follow us on social media and check out our website to sign up for updates on the race - jaimeharrison.com.

I'm a tax attorney by trade, a serial entrepreneur, an award-winning author, and the former Democratic Minority Leader in the Georgia House. I am running for governor to build a Georgia where every family has the freedom and opportunity to thrive. If voters put their faith in me, I will be the first Black woman governor in U.S. history. 
 
I like to say I'm Mississippi-raised but Georgia grown. I grew up in a big family (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and we moved to Georgia when both of my parents were called to ministry. I'm a proud alumna of Avondale High School in Dekalb, Spelman College, UT Austin, and Yale Law School. 
 
I believe that poverty is immoral and economically inefficient, and I believe we can use policy to end it. That's why I first ran for public office in 2006, and why I founded an organization to combat voter suppression and help eligible people of color register to vote in Georgia.
 
As the first woman to lead either party in the General Assembly and the first Black person to lead in the House, I worked to elect Democrats and prevent a Republican supermajority. I also stopped legislation to raise taxes on the poor and middle class and to roll back reproductive health care, and worked across the aisle to save the HOPE scholarship. 
 
I will continue that work as governor: Expand Medicaid for 500,000 Georgians, support educational opportunities for every Georgian, and support small businesses to build a thriving economy in all 159 counties.
 
Under the pen name Selena Montgomery, I've written 8 romantic suspense novels and (shameless plug) released my first non-fiction book (Minority Leader: How To Lead From the Outside and Make Real Change) earlier this year. 
 
I'll admit: I'm a pop culture junkie. I watch a lot of TV (right now: Supernatural, The Good Place, Living Single reruns, Leverage), I'm a big fan of Buffy and Star Trek (especially Voyager and TNG), and I'm a voracious reader (Colson Whitehead, Haruki Murakami, Nora Roberts, tax policy, and more).
 
I’m excited to answer your questions, and I’ll be around for about an hour starting at 3:20 PM. Ask me anything!

The report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, totaling nearly 1,000 pages, provided a bipartisan Senate imprimatur for an extraordinary set of facts: The Russian government undertook an extensive campaign to try to sabotage the 2016 American election to help Mr. Trump become president, and some members of Mr. Trump’s circle of advisers were open to the help from an American adversary.

Mueller III will testify to Congress in open session next month about his investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump.

The House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, in a late-night announcement Tuesday, said that 'pursuant to a subpoena' Mueller has agreed to appear before both panels on July 17.

'Americans have demanded to hear directly from the special counsel so they can understand what he and his team examined, uncovered, and determined about Russia's attack on our democracy, the Trump campaign's acceptance and use of that help, and President Trump and his associates' obstruction of the investigation into that attack,'' said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) in a statement. ''We look forward to hearing his testimony, as do all Americans.''

Megathread: Senate votes not to call witnesses in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial,57290,0.89,ewx4f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ewx4f7/megathread_senate_votes_not_to_call_witnesses_in/,27937,2020-2-1,"The Senate on Friday night narrowly rejected a motion to call new witnesses in Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, paving the way for a final vote to acquit the president by next week.

In a 51-49 vote, the Senate defeated a push by Democrats to depose former national security adviser John Bolton and other witnesses on their knowledge of the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump’s impeachment.

Two Republicans — Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah — joined all 47 Senate Democrats in voting for the motion. Two potential GOP swing votes, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, stuck with their party, ensuring Democrats were defeated.

The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant.

During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump’s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying that had the official who delivered the conclusion spoken less pointedly or left it out, they would have avoided angering the Republicans.

That intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire who has a reputation of delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms. The president announced on Wednesday that he was replacing Mr. Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and long an aggressively vocal Trump supporter.
