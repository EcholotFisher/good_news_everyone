These five megatrends present major global threats for planet Earth - problems that must be solved if the world is to remain a supportive habitat for humans and other species. DW looks at causes and possible solutions.
 Smog in Singapore (Reuters)
1. Air pollution and climate change.
Problem: Overloading of the atmosphere and of ocean waters with carbon. Atmospheric CO2 absorbs and re-emits infrared-wavelength radiation, leading to warmer air, soils, and ocean surface waters - which is good: The planet would be frozen solid without this.
Unfortunately, there's now too much carbon in the air. Burning of fossil fuels, deforestation for agriculture, and industrial activities have pushed up atmospheric CO2 concentrations from 280 parts per million (ppm) 200 years ago, to about 400 ppm today. That's an unprecedented rise, in both size and speed. The result: climate disruption.
Carbon overloading is only one form of air pollution caused by burning coal, oil, gas and wood. The World Health Organization recently estimated that one in nine deaths in 2012 were attributable to diseases caused by carcinogens and other poisons in polluted air.

Ocean life is suffering a triple whammy: overfishing, pollution and warming waters due to climate change
Solutions: Replace fossil fuels with renewable energy. Reforestation. Reduce emissions from agriculture. Change industrial processes.
The good news is that clean energy is abundant - it just needs to be harvested. Many say a 100 percent renewable-energy future is feasible with existing technology now.
But the bad news is that even though renewable energy infrastructure - solar panels, wind turbines, energy storage and distribution systems - are already widespread, and getting cheaper and more efficient all the time, experts say we're not applying them quickly enough to prevent catastrophic climate disruption. Barriers in policy and finance remain to be overcome.
2. Deforestation.
Problem: Species-rich wild forests are being destroyed, especially in the tropics, often to make way for cattle ranching, soybean or palm oil plantations, or other agricultural monocultures.

Destruction of forests has impacts for biodiversity and the climate
Today, about 30 percent of the planet's land area is covered by forests - which is about half as much as before agriculture got started around 11,000 years ago. About 7.3 million hectares (18 million acres) of forest are destroyed each year, mostly in the tropics. Tropical forests used to cover about 15 percent of the planet's land area; they're now down to 6 or 7 percent. Much of this remainder has been degraded by  logging or burning.
Not only do natural forests act as biodiversity reserves, they are also carbon sinks, keeping carbon out of the atmosphere and oceans.
Solutions: Conserve of what's left of natural forests, and restore degraded areas by replanting with native tree species. This requires strong governance - but many tropical countries are still developing, with increasing populations, uneven rule-of-law, and widespread cronyism and bribery when it comes to allocating land use.
3. Species extinction.
Problem: On land, wild animals are being hunted to extinction for bushmeat, ivory, or ""medicinal"" products. At sea, huge industrial fishing boats equipped with bottom-trawling or purse-seine nets clean out entire fish populations. The loss and destruction of habitat are also major factors contributing to a wave of extinction - unprecedented in that it is caused by a single species: humans. The IUCN's Red List of threatened and endangered species continues to grow.

Rhinos are killed for their horn, which some people falsely believe has medicinal properties
Not only do species inherently deserve to exist, they also provide products and ""services"" essential to human survival. Think bees and their pollinating prowess - necessary for growing food.
Solutions: Concerted efforts need to be made to prevent further loss of biodiversity. Protecting and restoring habitats is one side of this - protecting against poaching and wildlife trade is another. This should be done in partnership with locals, so that wildlife conservation is in their social and economic interest.
4. Soil degradation.
Problem: Overgrazing, monoculture planting, erosion, soil compaction, overexposure to pollutants, land-use conversion - there's a long list of ways that soils are being damaged. About 12 million hectares of farmland a year get seriously degraded, according to UN estimates.
Solutions: A wide range of soil conservation and restoration techniques exist, from no-till agriculture to crop rotation to water-retention through terrace-building. Given that food security depends on keeping soils in good condition, we're likely master this challenge in the long run. Whether this will be done in a way equitable to all people around the globe, remains an open question.

Terraces like these in China retain water and can help re-green degraded landscapes
5. Overpopulation.
Problem: Human population continues to grow rapidly worldwide. Humanity entered the 20th century with 1.6 billion people; right now, we're about 7.5 billion. Estimates put us at nearly 10 billion by 2050. Growing global populations, combined with growing affluence, is putting ever greater pressure on essential natural resources, like water. Most of the growth is happening on the African continent, and in southern and eastern Asia.
Solutions: Experience has shown that when women are empowered to control their own reproduction, and gain access to education and basic social services, the average number of births per woman drops precipitously.
Done right, networked aid systems could bring women out of extreme poverty, even in countries where state-level governance remains abysmal.

"Honest question, how is anti-enviromentalism even a thing?",4,0.84,7rx5ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enviroment/comments/7rx5ln/honest_question_how_is_antienviromentalism_even_a/,2,2018-1-21,"I know this post might seem like a rant against Americans, but I don't intend it to be. However, in light of the comments and videos I've been seeing in the last decade, and the brazenly denialist statements by the current POTUS, I've got to ask this.

How is anti-enviromentalism even a thing? And why it seems to be a very American phenomenon? Let me explain a few things.

I live in Slovakia. It is an European country, but not one of the ""treehugger"" ones. It's a country that only finished the leaded gasoline phaseout in 1994, where unrenovated factories used to poison the air just 2 decades ago, where many cars are quite old, and where most people don't exactly go out of their way to be ""green"". Yet, we have no denier movements of the sort I see in the US.

Sure, most people in Slovakia are not enviromentalists. Man who can afford it buy fast cars, those who cannot are often stuck with 20 year old ones, and our recycling rates are some of the lowest in the EU. Still, our goverment signed all the enviromental protocols despite being very corrupt otherwise (but there was no ""debate"" or ""controversy"" about signing them at all), people, even lovers of fast cars, prefer good fuel efficiency (with our average income, it is a must, not optional), The difference is, everyone I ever talked to about this here at least agrees that protecting the nature is a good thing, and that humans ARE destroying nature, even the people eith the worst enviromental habits here admit that  It seems to me that Americans don't only want the excessive resource usage that is their prime luxury, they want to FEEL GOOD about it too? If someone likes vintage cars that spew unfiltered exhaust here, they like vintage cars. They don't vote for politicians who say that any damage to the enviroment is a myth, they don't lick the boots of sleazy oil companies, they don't listen to jackasses saying stuff like ""it is cold today, checkmate you global warming believing fools"". Of course, there are a lot of people who believe conspiracy theories here, often really harebrained ones, but noone thinks that enviromental damage is a myth. My grandfather saw a whole forest die after a hydrofluoric acid plant was built in it 1950s, anyone who claims humans do no harm to the enviroment is either mentally defective, or a really well paid corporate shill.

The reason why I care, as you may say that it doesn't matter as Slovak or other people damage the enviroment regardless of their opinions, is that an individually enviromentably irresponsible person may pollute the enviroment, but will not hinder the attempts to save it, and may even support them. On the other hand, people who are deniers and want to desperately justify their habits (as opposed to shrugging and saying, duh, of course my car pollutes the air), will vote in denier politicians, say how banning lead and CFCs lead to ""job loss"" (forgetting that unregulated CFCs would destroy the ozone layer completely by 2065, with the subsequent UVC flux destroying all multicellular land life on Earth and returning us to Archean radiation conditions), because of course the jobs of ""hard American man"" are more important than the survival of multicellular life on Earth.

This is connected to an excessive focus on climate change, forgetting that even if their ridiculous theories were true, there are other still countless enviromental problems.

So, how do legally sane adults believe that humanity does not damage the enviroment because ""God will sort it out,"", while doing things like ""rolling coal"" (intentionally modifying your diesel to produce horrible black smoke) and reminescence about the good old smell of leaded gasoline? Do those people care about their children and their future at all?

To be honest, lying about the enviroment because a sleazy corporation pays you should be a crime. It endangers society in the same or even worse way than bribery does. CFCs could have eventually flooded Earth with radiation that you would normally expect on Mars and we know well how good is that for life. Leaded gasoline has made our collective IQ several points lower and the men making it often suffered poisoning to the point they hallucinated butterflies. I don't think we should be ""tolerant"" here, I guess if deniers had they way, the sudden wave of cancer and famine that would arrive after more than a century of CFCs would be all due to ""random variation"" and ""the ozone layer randomly switches off"" and other obvious lies."

Simply put, plastic pollution is a killer. Plastic bags from the grocery are responsible for everything from ugly litter to the death of wildlife. There is a simple yet effective way to completely eradicate all these harmful plastic bags.
Description
Recyclable bags is a great way to reduce these devastating numbers but the fact is, we often forget to carry our recyclable bags to the supermarkets. Then as human beings we don’t mind paying that mere 5 cents to get a plastic bag or even go to a store where they will provide us with bags to carry our products home. Such small every day subconscious behaviors are devastatingly contributing to long-term global warming effects and other natural disasters.

We can drastically change these statistics through a simple yet effective way of substituting these harmful plastic bags with 100% cotton meshed, natural and compostable bags. It may sound unconventional but a number of countries have followed this route including South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Bangladesh.

Aviva’s Community fund will help us start a sustainable environment project to dramatically reduce plastic bags in Penticton and the surrounding Okanagan community. It will provide businesses and communities to an alternative option and provide a creative solution to reduce their impact on the environment.

Aviva’s community fund will help with the initial purchase and distribution of these 100% ecofriendly bags to all retail outlets, whereby encouraging the consumer to choose these ecofriendly bags instead of plastic bags. This step will also provide an avenue to educate both staff and the general public through informative brochures and posters. A lot of people will be curious about it at first, and when they find out what it’s for, they will be excited to become a part of it. When consumers opt to pay for a shopping bag, they will be given a choice to either purchase a plastic bag, or go with a 100% cotton bag for 0.15 cents. The price for the 100% ecofriendly bag could be lowered even further if a grocery store is willing to match the customer donations for each 0.5 cents. Perhaps this option will help shift the mindset of retail stores to eventually convert to a 100% free from plastic shopping bags.

This type of exposure, thanks to Aviva’s funds, can and will help us achieve a strategic alliance with retailers in order to attain a common goal of working towards a plastic free environment and sustaining our environment. It will help us to partner with Greener Footprints to work with retailers and the community to establish plastic bag free towns across Canada. This will create publicity for the town and the concept at a local, provincial, and a national level. Thanks to Aviva we can take that one important step of choosing to become a completely plastic bag free Canada. "

So basically it is a Platform like Tripadvisor or your local Pizza app where User can rate a company.
But instead of rating their products, you are rating the working conditions, the processes/raw materials they use, their emission and so on.
Companies with better conditions could be examples and they will make profit from having a greener image, because its good advertising! They could share their knowledge to other companies which maybe don't even know that there is a better way of producing.

- Fight deforestation and preserve 200sqm of rainforest Central America.
- Provide two months of clean drinking water to a child in the Central African Republic.
- Give two months of education to a child in India.

Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1965, the Federal Lands and Energy Security Act of 2013, with a bipartisan vote of 228-192. This package of bills would protect and expand onshore [American energy production](http://kenzieduncan.blogspot.com/2013/01/asia-global-energy-review-14-trillion.html) and create new American jobs by streamlining government red-tape and regulations. Also, this legislation would establish an efficient and effective process to responsibly produce both renewable and conventional energy on our federal lands as part of a true all-of-the-above approach American energy production.

“For far too long the Obama Administration has deliberately blocked increased energy exploration and development in America, causing both oil and natural gas production on federal land to decline since President Obama took office. The real growth in American energy production is happening on state and private lands and this bill would bring that growth to federal lands,” said Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings (WA-04). “This legislation unleashes America’s energy potential on federal lands by streamlining the federal permitting process and opening up proven energy reserves to increased energy production in places like the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The passage of this legislation today is an important step forward to increase much-needed energy production in America that will create jobs, grow the economy, and make energy more affordable for hardworking American families.”

H.R. 1965, the Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act of 2013, includes the following five Natural Resources bills:
Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act (Lamborn CO-05) - This bill would reform the leasing process for onshore oil and natural gas projects on federal lands to eliminate unnecessary delays; reform the process for energy permitting, once a lease is in hand, to encourage the timely development of our federal resources; ensure funds are available for efficient wind and solar permitting; and set clear rules for the development of U.S. oil shale resources.

Planning for American Energy Act (Tipton, CO-03) - This bill would establish common sense steps to create an all-of-the-above American energy plan for using federal lands to meet our Nation’s energy needs.

National Petroleum Reserve Alaska Access Act (Hastings, WA-04) - This bill would cut through bureaucratic red tape to unlock the full potential of energy resources in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) by ensuring that oil and natural gas are developed and transported in a timely and efficient manner.

BLM Live Internet Auctions Act (Johnson, OH-06) - This bill would give the Secretary of the Interior the authority to conduct internet-based auctions for onshore leases to ensure the best return to the Federal taxpayer, reduce fraud, and secure the leasing process.

Native American Energy Act (Young, AK-At Large) - This bill would streamline burdensome and duplicative government regulations and remove the barriers erected by the Obama Administration that are blocking Indian tribes from developing energy resources on their own land and creating new jobs."

Help save the world in under one minute!,1,0.67,83q7ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enviroment/comments/83q7ul/help_save_the_world_in_under_one_minute/,0,2018-3-12,"I hope I am not wrong for posting this here. Please let me know before you kick me from the subreddit. I just wanted to share a great opportunity for anyone that purchases ANYTHING online to help save the environment and offset global warming. If I break the rules it is because this is a FREE and PASSIVE way to save the earth in under one (1) minute of effort. 

TL;DR Signing up, in only one minute,  connects users to a platform that uses 66% of  commissions from 3500+ business partners to support Reforestation and Protection Projects, Methane Capture at Landfills, and Renewable Energy Technology installations. AT NO COST TO USERS! Link is at the bottom of the page.

Full disclosure I am a Student Sustainability Coordinator at my University. I am also serving as a Brand Ambassador for Ucapture on my Campus. It is important to say that the carbon offsets generated by user activity are recorded under the name of the school that referred the user to our platform. This is why I posted a personalized link. With your help, my university can offset a meaningful portion of our carbon footprint without blowing the sustainability budget. Our goal is to offset 30% of our 100,000 metric ton annual carbon footprint.

Ucapture is a FREE google browser extension that activates automatically on any given partner’s website. If you sign up now an email will be sent when extensions are back up and running on Firefox and Safari. There is also an iPhone app, but the extension is the best because it is passive. 

 If the businesses are a partner then they pay a commission on your purchase, at no cost to you! Ucapture uses two-thirds of commissions earned to fund carbon offset projects. Currently Ucapture averages eight pounds of carbon offset per dollar spent with our partners. Take Expedia an average person’s foot print from a flight is about 1000lbs of CO2. If bought as a Ucapture partner, avg ticket price $110, Ucapture can offset 800-1200lbs annually for the length of the project (8-15yrs). So one plane ticket could offset 10,000lbs over the projects life!  Most of the time it offsets the entire flight, but even if you don’t fly that is still less than $10 of online spending a MONTH
Some partners don’t even have a large carbon footprint, so the offset is higher. These projects are certified for the carbon offset by agencies like the Climate Action Reserve (CAR).

Ucapture has over 3,500 business partners such as Best Buy, Budget, Dish, Fandango, Groupon, and Walmart. With the amount and variety of partners it has never been easier to support projects such as reforestation, renewable energy technology, and methane capture at landfills (26X denser that CO2). It only takes one minute to take advantage of this platform and help slow global warming. The attached link will take you to the sign-up page. After signing up, install the browser extension in the upper right corner and you’re done! It really does only take one minute! 

The browser extension will also automatically pull up any applicable coupons for your purchase. Ucapture offers a way to push the cost of environmentalism back onto the corporations and businesses. I think Ucapture has alot of potential and the more poeple that use it the more change we can create. Please take one minute to save your wallet and save the Earth.

The basic idea around health is that we should not just focus on health equality, but also health equity. Sometimes members of socially disadvantaged groups may need support to achieve their health goals. 
Environmental injustice is defined as the the racial discrimination in environmental policy making and the enforcement of regulations and laws; the deliberate targeting of people of color communities for toxic and hazardous waste facilities; the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities.
Below are two links, the first to a TED talk we watched about ""greening the ghetto,"" detailing a woman's fight for environmental justice in the South Bronx, and the second link is to a case study on the intersection of health and environmental justice in Louisiana.

Worldwide, there is focus and attention to, along with widespread awareness of the impact on our world. There is an increased enlightenment and realization that we each must do our bit to contribute to helping the environment and reducing the negative impact to it. DOT is a one of a kind Green Mobility solutions providing [green bike taxi service](http://gowithdot.com/) for individuals, corporate and events to be able to contribute to the betterment of the environment through a reduction in their carbon footprint. DOT's green logistics are popular across all metro stations where they are operational, and they are great for first and last mile connectivity. 

DOT follows a PPP Model and by this, the organization means: it Promises to Deliver People and Packages on Green Modes of Transportation comprising [environment friendly](http://gowithdot.com/) electric vehicles. DOT connects people from metro or bus stations to their destination through ebikes. DOT's delivery solution is rapidly being adopted by many businesses that choose to go green by replacing existing vehicles used in delivery with sustainable electric vehicles operated by DOT. With Delhi/NCR’s air quality having been found to have deadly PM2.5 levels that are 10 times higher than the safety limit prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), and four times higher than even the Indian safety limits in a recent air monitoring survey, DOT’s first initiative has been piloted in the National Capital Region (NCR). This one of a kind go green project, the DOT green bike taxi service offers customers and corporate clients effective, pocket-friendly and environmental safe [green logistics](http://gowithdot.com/) to deliver people, packages, and promises. Through this project, the aim is to help its citizens make Delhi/NCR a better place to live, by helping to reduce the now alarming pollution levels in the city and thereby bettering the air quality in the city. The need for sustainable, reliable, consistent, comfortable, efficient and cost-effective transport options for last mile connectivity and the need for efficiency in reaching the desired destination safely, within a prescribed, reasonable time frame is a problem area that DOT addresses. The newly introduced e-bikes are the perfect antidote for Delhi’s challenges. Combined with transport solutions which are easier on the environment and work to reduce carbon emissions, DOT’s transport solutions are both smart and efficient alternate solutions which help to make the city a healthier place to live in. The added focus on ethics and standards of service are ensured by the end to end processes within DOT which focus on necessary background checks for selected drivers for e-bikes, along with necessary training, and regular checks, with added security measures like GPS devices installed in the e-bikes.

It’s time global warming is taken seriously and we do our part in ensuring that the future generations have a greener world to live in. Becoming [environment friendly](http://gowithdot.com/) is the only way forward, and DOT is your ideal partner.

After watching all the documentaries and reading a handful of articles I can find and trying to see both sides I'm left being very confused. I can see a lot of dangers obviously, but how dangerous is it really? How accurate are movies like gassland and fracknation? I've watched both documentaries and I don't know which one is more accurate. I feel like most things I read are anti fracking and may be a little biased, but I am not sure what these people who are against fracking have to lose besides home values and their health ect. Which would honestly lead to a better conclusion than energy companies that have millions to lose. At the same time fracknation seems to have no money from energy companies (from the little research I have done) and the journalist may just be doing it for attention (although almost all of the people interviewed in the film stand to lose money if fracking is ceased), but it has honestly left me not knowing what to think. So i guess my question is where can I find the best information on the dangers and exactly how much damage has been done by fracking? "

Spain adopts policies that HURT wind and other renewable energy sources,1,1.0,1x5taa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enviroment/comments/1x5taa/spain_adopts_policies_that_hurt_wind_and_other/,0,2014-2-6,"The Portuguese Renewable Energy Association (APREN) put out a note in its website… it explains Spain will move forward with its plans to eliminate all subsidies to wind parks built before 2004; but the problem is in the case of Spain it will affect 8,440MW out of the 22,800MW installed base – or 37% of its capacity. In addition to that, those wind parks built after 2004 or the remainder of the wind installed capacity – will see a 50% cut on subsidies. The wind energy association explained those firms affected by the new policy will have to deal with financial difficulties associated with a sudden lower cash flow and, in addition to that, will have to be forced to depreciate their assets a lot faster. In other words if we increase depreciation, net profit will fall…so it is a double whammy: cut in revenue and increase in depreciation. The note mentioned wind, solar will not be the only ones affected, as the new rules will be extended to 14 waste management plants, to  1,000 micro-hydro facilities, to 63 biomass plants and 127 biogas plants as well.
It is difficult to imagine any scenario where the odds could be so much against renewables as this outcome. It is important for governments to understand they need to create a stable environment where businesses can plan and operate… in addition to that, governments should not renege on their promises either for that generates unnecessary uncertainty in those markets. It is important for us to understand the accelerated depreciation and cut in cash flow will be a severe punch on those firm’s financials: investors – which include pension funds – have an expectation of return and will not be pleased with this sudden change; it will also be more difficult for utilities to invest in Wind – or other renewables for that matter – for fear the government will yet again change its mind and renege on something else. Governments cannot treat private enterprise as a punching bag… private firms are needed in order to conduct applied research and they take all of the risk on R&D investing, so they do perform an important role in society and the deployment of clean energies. 
We need to use social media to voice our discontent with Spain’s policies… if the wave catches on, we might see similar policies in Europe and elsewhere – which hurts the interests of those who believe we should be working faster to reduce carbon emissions; if anything, Spain’s policies are doing the opposite.

This is where this idea come up.

What Energy Assessment means to you,0,0.5,1l95dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enviroment/comments/1l95dm/what_energy_assessment_means_to_you/,1,2013-8-28,"An energy assessment is an inspection, survey and analysis of energy flows for energy conservation in a building aiming to reduce the amount of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the output.  When the object of study is an occupied building then reducing energy consumption while maintaining or improving human comfort, health and safety are of primary concern. Beyond simply identifying the sources of energy use, an energy assessment aims to prioritise the energy uses according to the greatest to least cost effective opportunities for energy savings.

The term energy assessment is most commonly used to describe a broad spectrum of energy studies ranging from a quick walk-through of a facility to identify major problem areas to a comprehensive analysis of the implications of alternative energy efficiency measures sufficient to satisfy the financial criteria of sophisticated investors. Audit is required to identify the most efficient and cost-effective Energy Conservation Opportunities (ECOs) or Measures (ECMs).

The main issues of an energy assessments are:

The analysis of building and utility data, including the installed equipment and analysis of energy bills;
The survey of the real operating conditions;
The understanding of the building behaviour and of the interactions with weather, occupancy and operating schedules;
The selection and the evaluation of energy conservation measures;
The estimation of energy saving potential;
The identification of customer concerns and needs.

You can map all Accents in Accents map, NATURE SOUNDS, All animal sounds in one map, city sounds, All Music in one Map, etc!

Motion Graphics Script, while you make an instructional video of a guy navigating a ""prototype"" with Infinite Zoom  Trend (like this one [https://vimeo.com/201150328](https://vimeo.com/201150328) but it will be like navigating trough the website ): 

**Script** (needs to be shortened and juiced):

Audiowikia is going to be a major revolution in the way we search and listen to music, and music producers search for samples and song templates.

You can type any map or music or sound that you want, or just simply state what you want, or navigate the sci fi menu.

You hover on the maps to play the songs (Like a UFO, no need to click), and you can scroll to be teleported to diferent maps using the samples as bases.

you gain karma points by uploading, rating, tagging, reacting to samples and songs in which you can use to download songs

It will also incorporate a Magic Music School subscription with a lot of features\* , including learning melodies and rap trough rap and singing templates , which

are suggested from your favorite sounds and songs,

You can learn music trough your favorite Songs!

one of the genius part about audiowiki is that you don\`t even need to rate a song, it collects data from your bodily and facial reactions to create your emotional

portrait of the song which gets added to the overall portrait of that song.Emotions like fear, surprise, joy, inpiration , relaxation and dance are all included in the

emoptional painting of that song, you earn karma points just by being yourself!

a simple S button and you can save the sound on the folder you drag it to.

you can then download all the music and sounds that you want, you can even totally costumize the sounds of your cellphone in a simple way, imagine having every

contact with a new song based on how the person makes you feel!

you can then search music by the emotion it will make you feel, based on your past reactions and favorited [sounds.You](https://sounds.you/) can search music trough many ways, THERE ARE

even 6 ways of shuffling for premium users!

With audiowikia we will Surf into a new era of a Diamond Age in music industry, with much more richness in music samples, more rap templates , more study of sound

and APIS developed for the ongoing project

, like a dating app which pairs compatible moans, a cool dancing Karaoke with quick learning dance videos, you can even

schedule a jam with your favorite artist or friends if they like the ""radiopreview"" of your best song.

Moderators will be crutial and on every map to sellect the most characteristic part of a song,so called a ""radiopreview"" so you can navigate and get a good notion

of what the music is without having to listen from the start, and to rate and let shine the samples with the most quality.

this technique allied with connecting your music folders to other folders with similar tastes will potentially save us countless centuries of having to listen to bad

music to find the holy grails we are searching for.

Never listen to bad music again.

Audiowikia, New Audiolife for Everybody!

**PS>Next step will be to create an augmented music library on shrubberies and trees in parks and forests, where each seed or leaf contains a piece of musical information,**

**and you can gently hover with your finger or use it as a laser and touch the seeds to play Music! Invite your friends to the park to listen to music with you! All the parks and forests in the**

**world can suddently become Spacy Silent Augmented Discos that Respect Nature!**

**We can Occupy\* the forests with Dancers and Music to save the World!**
