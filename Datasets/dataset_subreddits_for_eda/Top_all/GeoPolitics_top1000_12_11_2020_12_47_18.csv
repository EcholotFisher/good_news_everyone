"""China is under US attack, but the world has no sympathy for us""-Dai Xu",2660,0.82,hv6bnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/hv6bnn/china_is_under_us_attack_but_the_world_has_no/,778,2020-7-21,"Hi everyone! This is my first post in r/geopolitics

So glad to have found a community that shares my interests.

The URL links to a news article in Korean about a speech given by top Chinese military strategist Dai Xu. He is like the Chinese version of Bolton (was it John?.. anyways..).

This is the original article :   [https://news.joins.com/article/23828567](https://news.joins.com/article/23828567) 

I have taken the liberty to translate it to English, I am not native so please excuse any mistakes..:) Might be a bit long but I think it was a very interesting read.

&#x200B;

Here we go.

&#x200B;

China has been under unprecedented levels of attack on all sides by the US, giving rise to a sense of poignant regret that China has been misunderstanding the US. A speech regarding this issue given by Professor Dai Xu from China’s National Defense University has recently been gaining much attention from Chinese media.

Dai Xu is one of China’s most representative military hawk’s; he was chosen as one of the most influential figures in 2010 and is also widely known for being“one of Henan’s (Xu’s hometown) top three brains”.

While the United States is reviewing a travel ban on all CCP members and their family members to the US, Dai Xu’s speech on “four things that China overlooked and ten new perceptions about the United States” has been a popular topic among the Chinese.

The first thing Dai Xu claims that China has overlooked about the US is that China didn’t realize that America had so much resentment against them. According to Xu, President Donald Trump has not even a speck of goodwill for China and although he has been calling them a series of names including “trade terrorist”, “invader of the global economy”, “cheaters”, “thieves”, “rule breakers”, to the Chinese, America’s grudge feels like a punch out of the blue. While America says it will not idly stand by and ignore all of China’s evildoings, Xu adds that America is using all its resources to “demonize” China.

The second is that China did not know America’s tactics would be so ‘brutal’. Dai Xu said that China’s top government officials and professionals, himself included, did not expect an all-out attack from the US, without any wiggle room to even take a breath. US-China relations have been woven tightly over a long period of time which is why China thought that unless the US was out of their mind, it would not impose 20 billion tariffs on Chinese goods. However, America’s strong measures have taken China by surprise, highly exceeding its expectations.

The third is that while China is being beaten down by the US, not a single country has neither stood up at their defense nor even expressed a drop of sympathy. While numerous countries are against  America’s trade measures, none of them have spoken out against the US or stood next to China, the greatest victim of the trade war. Xu said that although China has been assisting many countries around the world and these countries have benefited much from China, none of them have stood up for them when most needed.

The fourth is that to fight China, America has built a unified front. Republicans and Democrats disagree over any and every issue except on that of measures and policies on China; on these they are completely united. What is most surprising, Xu says, is that no member of the US Congress has spoken in favor of China and because of these four issues, it is time for China to see the US from a different perspective.

10 new perspectives about the US according to Dai Xu

1. The US is a ‘real tiger’ not a ‘paper tiger’
2. Must not assume that the US will continue making mistakes
3. The US puts profit before ideology and value
4. Never say “We are number one”, “we are better” before the US
5. The US is indifferent about committing crimes against others
6. Must admit that the US is the world’s “big boss”
7. Do not mention “sharing information” before the US
8. The US is a master strategist: Do not become their enemy
9. Must not hope that the US elections will change the US’ national strategy
10. Must not naively think about fighting the US until the end

First, China must realize that the US is a ‘real tiger’ that devours, not a ‘paper tiger’. American politicians are neither gentlemen nor philanthropists but workers who are devoted and prepared to do anything for their nation and its voters.

Second, China must not assume that the US will continue making mistakes. The US is a country that will turn its national strategy around 180 degrees if it deems its strategy to be wrong. The US can change masks quicker than you turn a page in a book.

Third, The US puts profit before ideology and value. When making money from the Americans, China must be careful and quickly catch onto changes to their facial expressions. Make sure that the money is flowing both ways and not unilaterally toward China.

Fourth, never say “we are number one”, “we are better” before the US. Even if the thought crosses your mind, take it as a sign to take a step down and be more modest.

Fifth, the US is indifferent about committing crimes against others. Although the US has many allies, it will not go as far as to sacrifice its core interests just to maintain the alliance friendly.

Sixth, must admit that the US is the world’s “big boss”. Although it is difficult to accept, it is the reality. The US controls vast amounts of resources, much greater than those China does. The best possible scenario for China is to digest and absorb US technology. And even after absorbing American technology, China must not go around blabbering that it is their “innovation”.

Seventh, do not mention “sharing information” in front of the US. Intellectual property is very important in the US. If you ask to share this technology you will be stamped as a “thief”.

Eighth, the US is a master strategist. Things will become very difficult once you become an enemy of the US. America’s war against terrorism shows us that the US can and will pool all its resources together, follow you to the very end of the earth and then kill you.

Ninth, do not hope that the US elections will change the US’ national strategy. The “Make America Great Again” strategy will not change even if the president does.

Tenth, do not be naïve and think you will be able to fight the US until the end. Every action made by the US has a butterfly effect. The US has many allies and many partnerships around the globe. If the US imposes a 30 billion dollar tariff on China, this will have a ripple effect and blow up into 60 billion, even 90 billion dollars’ worth of effects.

This is the reason why the US is so strong. Dai Xu says, if China wants to take on the US, it must approach with reason and not rage, wisely and courageously."

Removes the danger of 50 million single males getting angry, it imports more working age people in the form of those brides, and it helps correct the future demographic issues. Seems like a big win if you're willing to throw human suffering and decency out the window.

**My observation**

Over the last years that I have followed this sub, I have observed a noticeable decline in the quality of the comments. It used to be much more rigorous and academic in its analysis of events.

The above comment that I linked is a great example of something that does not belong in this sub (r/news r/worldnews would be the far more appropriate subs).

The above comment is pure sarcasm, to express OP's contempt for Chinese government (which arguably rightly so). But this is not a virtue signaling sub. We didn't come here to read things that we can read everywhere else on reddit and on twitter. We didn't come here to rage about Trump and praise Obama.

We came here for analysis. Geopolitics goes beyond morality. It is about power, projection and compromise.

Yes, Morality is an important tool in the arsenals of geopoliticians. And an adversarial authoritarian government (China) is much more dangerous than an adversarial democratic nation. And your contempt for the CCP's lack of morals should be expressed in this format.

A constructive analysis would include that given the communist party has control over media and leeways in its ability to do things that would otherwise infeasible in other controls. What are the logical options that the communist party would undertake to handle the nation's declining birth rate?

A rubbish comment is exactly like above, it is the classical reddit virtue signaling at full display. The rubbish comment is not about slave brides as a feasible solution. It is about using it as an opportunity to list the crimes of the CCP. I mean, import 50 million slave brides? Even in Genghis Khan era, I don't know if it is feasible. You are just listing CCP's dirty laundry without an ounce of coherent analysis.

&#x200B;

**My recommendation**

We need much stronger moderation in this sub. It is not about limiting free speech. It is about maintaining the integrity and quality of the sub. Academic journals do not allow anyone to publish there. Because rigorous analysis, debates and opposing viewpoints can only flourish conditioned on removing low quality distraction and noise.

More concretely, comments that are borderline low quality can be downvoted by the sub, comments that obviously fall below a certain quality bar should be removed via moderation, and egregiously low quality comments like above should result in temporary banning of the member.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: Note to moderators, this is in no way a criticism of your volunteering work. I wholeheartedly appreciate and thank you for growing this wonderful community. It has given people like me (who is not a student of geopolitics and interested in it) to learn from people far smarter than me.

EDIT 2: Scrubbed my post because I used the f-bomb. I apologies. I should have better controls.

EDIT 3: I removed my examples. I wrote the examples as ""analysis"". But as u/weilim correctly pointed out, my comments relating to geopolitics are also low quality and do not belong in this sub. I removed it so not to distract the discussion about moderation of the sub.

I was trying to be sarcastic while forgetting that I was trying to argue for moderating away sarcasm. I was trying to advocate and provide an example of analysis but of course, I am not capable of such in depth analysis. I mean, with stronger moderation, someone like me should just stop commenting in this sub!

Linking to people who correctly called my examples out as being low quality.

Some thoughts on China's initial handling of COVID19,1145,0.9,fnvvh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/fnvvh8/some_thoughts_on_chinas_initial_handling_of/,309,2020-3-24,"One part of the ongoing discussion and debate about the COVID19 pandemic has revolved about how China handled the initial emergence of it in Wuhan.

I have a few thoughts of my own, for what mistakes were made, and on the issue of ""cover-ups"".

My background; I moonlight as a PLA watcher and Chinese geopol commenter on this Reddit account and you may have read some of my PLA-related pieces on *The Diplomat*. Full disclosure, I'm not a virologist or epidemiologist, but I've been following this story since about early January and for my day job I am a junior doctor, so like to think I have some training to make sense of some of the disparate pieces of information both on the medical side as well as Chinese language/politics side of things.

====

First of all, to get it out of the way, IMO the PRC handling of COVID19 did have mistakes and flaws, specifically in terms of *speed*, such as:

* Speed of conveying information from regional to national health authorities.
* Speed of processing information and actioning plans.
* Speed of confirming key characteristics of the virus; such as human to human (H2H) transmission, sequencing the genome of the virus, etc.

But at this stage I don't think there is any evidence of deliberate or systemic ""cover-up"" of the virus as described in some threads. There seem to be three particular main accusations of ""systemic cover-up"" that I've seen: Censorship; reporting of H2H transmission; and Destroying of Samples. I have some thoughts on these below.

====

**Censorship**:

* By now the name of Dr Li Wenliang is infamous when talking about China's handling of COVID19, as an example of a whistleblower. A number of other doctors were also reprimanded for ""spreading rumours"" in early January, and overall state media reporting of the virus was very strict with significant censorship regarding the details of the ongoing investigation and information that the government had at hand.
* I personally believe that the censorship of Dr Li and some other doctors was *unhelpful*, however I also do not believe this is evidence of a deliberate or let alone systemic ""cover-up"". The initial [timeline](https://i.imgur.com/YNOCI5w.jpg) (graph from [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316?query=featured_home)) of actions to investigate the ""unusual cases of pneumonia"" show  health authorities were already in the mix and had communicated their initial information with the WHO in early January -- at the same time as they were actively censoring various posts on social media about the new pneumonia/novel virus. In fact, it was someone else in Wuhan -- Dr Zhang Jixian who first noticed the cluster of strange pneumonia on about 26/27th December and alerted health authorities and prompted them into action.
* If Dr Li had made his posts with the deliberate desire to warn the public that nothing was being done to investigate the new cluster of infections, then I would strongly agree that he should be described as a whistle-blower and that the government's actions to censor him (and other social media posts) were out of a desire to do a ""cover-up"". But in the context of the investigations going on before and after Dr Li made his Wechat post (December 30), I think the censorship around the time of early January is an ethical question of weighing the costs and benefits of releasing yet to be verified information to the public earlier -- **versus** waiting to verify information and then conveying that information to the public later.
* Authorities went for the latter choice, and even now, over two months later I'm not sure if their choice was better or worse.
   * Disclosing un-verified information to the public might've resulted in more cautious voluntary social distancing and sanitary behaviours by the public, which may have reduced the spread of the disease...
   * But OTOH it also may have caused more people in Wuhan to panic and leave the epicenter than otherwise, potentially distributing many more cases around the country (and around the world) before the government had the verified information to put in proper lockdown or quarantine measures in place.
   * I'm sure we can all appreciate that putting in a lockdown of the scale they eventually did, is not something that can be made without significant, verified information and intelligence.
* Dr Li of course was a hero, but IMO he was a hero for being one of the first (and unfortunately likely one of the likely-to-be-many) frontline HCWs that gave their lives to combat the pandemic.
   * Given what we know the authorities were actively working on behind the scenes however, I do not think his Wechat post in his private group (which he asked to not be shared publicly) was a case of trying to blow a whistle on what the government *wasn't* doing.
   * Instead, he was trying to warn some close friends and colleagues to keep a heads up on what he initially thought were cases of SARS (he was wrong on that count but very close given COVID19 is caused by another coronavirus dubbed SARS-CoV-2) -- but someone in that group distributed his warning without his consent. The local authorities ended up pinning the blame on Dr Li, which of course was in turn criticized by higher national authorities and with various levels of more formal countermanding recently.
* There are also bigger ethical questions about the costs versus the need for censorship in terms of having transparency but also the enabling of disinformation to spread. For COVID19 itself even on Chinese social media, even now there are still cases of significant disinformation either deliberate or accidental, which companies have to actively [inform](https://www.weibo.com/weibopiyao?is_hot=1) their userbase of. (My personal favourite was a post going around in late January that the PLAAF was going to be sent in to cover Wuhan with disinfectant from the air.)

====

**Human to human (H2H) transmission**:

* One of the other main arguments about the ""cover-up"" is that the H2H potential for the disease was actively buried. I believe this news has re-emerged in the last week or so with some health professionals in Taiwan saying they were ignored by the WHO after received statements from colleagues in Wuhan about the disease being H2H transmissible.
* This particular argument is dicey as well, because it is easy to argue in hindsight that obviously the virus is H2H capable. But when the initial cluster of cases presented, it was still under investigation if it was from a specific source and whether there was ""sustained"" H2H transmission versus ""limited"" H2H transmission.
* In hindsight, we can easily argue that the investigation and waiting for [confirmation](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/20/c_138721762.htm) of sustained H2H transmission wasted time that could've been used to act sooner -- and I agree with that. In future, lessons might be taken to err on the side of caution to take strong measures even if a disease is thought to initially have ""limited"" H2H transmission.

====

**Destroying of samples**:

* This argument is a bit more recent but also a bit more easily examined. An article by Caixin documenting various steps in which the virus was initially investigated, has started to make some rounds in the English language media. Specifically, the part where various labs were ordered to destroy their samples of the virus on January 3rd. This order is seen as an example again, of the government ordering a cover-up and burying their head in the sand.
* But if one reads the original [article](https://xw.qq.com/cmsid/TWF2020022701654200?f=newdc), and looks at the relevant part [here](https://i.imgur.com/2DU8lnA.jpg), the actual order asks various labs to hand over samples or destroy their samples to other institutions. Presumably this was in relation to wanting to centralize and streamline efforts to investigate the virus samples, but also if some labs didn't have the requisite biosafety level to investigate the virus safely -- when they realized how dangerous the virus was, it likely would've been judged to be ""too hot"" for certain labs to handle.
* It is also rather telling IMO that on the same day (January 3rd) that the notice for labs to handover their samples to designated institutes or destroy them, the National IVDC [identified](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e3c63ca9-dedb-4fb6-9c1c-d057adb77b57) the sequence of the coronavirus themselves -- i.e.: that yes, while a number of labs were judged to be no longer capable of handling the virus, others would be continuing and centralizing their work on it.

====

Based on the above, I think the evidence and arguments at present don't indicate that there was any systemic cover-up where the government was seeking to avoid going public with information that they had already verified or confirmed internally -- rather they themselves were waiting for their investigations to present verified results, meaning they were shutting down public revelations of information they deemed to be un-verified. This again becomes an ethical question of benefits vs costs as aforementioned.

Going back to the ***flaws*** in the system, I think it was primarily around speed. If this were another, less virulent disease with a more distinctive presentation and a shorter incubation time, I think the authorities' reaction speeds would've been able to manage it.

But the virus gets a say as well.

We are likely to see articles and investigations going forwards to find when patient zero may have been (one recent article suggests the earliest case with retrospective testing may have been in November). However, by the time there were *enough* cases of this disease to alert health authorities that *something weird is going on*, and by the time their investigations were able to verify the key characteristics of the virus -- it was already preordained that it would cause a disaster in Wuhan at the epicenter.

Hindsight is 2020, but sometimes nature moves faster than the speed of human health bureaucracy and the present speed of human science. That isn't to say they can't ameliorate some of the flaws; in particular streamlining the bureaucracy further. On the political side of things, IMO that is likely strengthen Xi's reforms to further enhance central government power.

And in case anyone asks -- yes, I do trust China's numbers for tracking the disease, in the sense that I believe the numbers they have are the true ones they have internally and they're not ""secretly hiding"" the ""true number"".

Initially the lack of testing capacity meant they were inevitably under-counting cases (unfortunately being repeated now in multiple other places too), but I think they have a handle on it now and even if the exact pin point numbers aren't perfect I believe in the overall trend. The fact that they added ""15,000"" cases on February 13th as a result of changing diagnostic criteria to include patients diagnosed via CT due to a lack of testing kits -- IMO -- is evidence that national health authorities aren't afraid of looking bad if it can better capture the clinical reality.

\------------

Finally, it is possible evidence may emerge in the future that attempts to deliberately cover-up the disease **were** made -- but the major arguments for it at this stage IMO do not point to such a case."

Fallout from the Beirut explosion and a hypothesis,1094,0.9,i49uhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/i49uhs/fallout_from_the_beirut_explosion_and_a_hypothesis/,200,2020-8-6,"What happened in Beirut was a tremendous tragedy so first let me say that I wish everyone there a speedy recovery and, ideally, a calmer existence than what they've had to deal with in the last few years.

There is an aspect of the Beirut explosion that is not being talked about yet but that I expect will have major repercussions in the country if it comes out and I think it bears discussing.

From what we know now, the explosion derived from Ammonium Nitrate stored in the port facility from 2014 until the explosion this week and the direct cause of the fire was accidental. Obviously people will continue to dispute these details but as of this writing they appear to be sound and moving gradually towards conclusive.

Thus the issue is one of negligence. Why was the Ammonium Nitrate kept in the port facility for so long despite many warnings from administrators that it was dangerous? Here is where my hypothesis is relevant.

[Last summer The Daily Telegraph broke a story after a three-month investigation, revealing that Hezbollah had attempted to establish what they called 'a potential bomb factory' North of London](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/06/09/iran-linked-terrorists-caught-stockpiling-explosives-north-west/) with the ultimate goal of striking Israeli targets in the UK/Europe and that in the process of arresting them British police had recovered ""thousands of ice packs containing *three metric tons of Ammonium Nitrate*"". That was in Autumn 2015.

The same article describes another Hezbollah property in Cyprus that had been raided that summer with *eight tons of Ammonium Nitrate*.

In the days that followed that article, more articles emerged as it turned out that the foreign intelligence source that tipped off the British and Cypriot authorities was, unsurprisingly, Mossad. [Israeli officials revealed that there was another foiled attack as well. Hezbollah had tried the same thing in Thailand.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-planned-immense-game-changing-terror-attacks-report/) ""Mossad information enabled Thai authorities to nab a cell in the country in early 2015, followed in April of that year by the arrest of Hezbollah operative Hussein Abdullah in Cyprus after his cellar was found to contain *a ton of ammonium nitrate.*""

Let's consider that timeline for a minute. This week, Lebanese authorities said the massive quantity of Ammonium Nitrate was seized and placed in the port facility in 2014. In 2015, Hezbollah set up bases in a number of locations around the world with cells intending to attack Israeli targets. Each cell was found with literal tons of Ammonium Nitrate.

[Finally within the last two years (the article came out only months ago) yet another Hezbollah cell with Ammonium Nitrate was discovered in southern Germany.](https://www.jpost.com/international/germany-confirms-mossad-help-with-hezbollah-ban-but-upset-about-credit-627888) ""One of the discoveries made thanks to the Mossad intelligence was a collection of warehouses in southern Germany belonging to Hezbollah operatives and containing hundreds of kilograms of ammonium nitrate, which is used to make explosives.""

My hypothesis is that the reason the confiscated Ammonium Nitrate was neither used, disposed of or moved to a safer location despite [many requests and warnings was](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2020/08/05/Authorities-knew-ammonium-nitrate-stored-at-Beirut-port-was-dangerous-Customs-head) because Hezbollah's leadership (which is part of the Lebanese government) considered it a weapons stockpile and keeping it in the port made it convenient to send off to locations they might want to target in the future.

This is of course only a hypothesis and it could be wrong. But if it is correct *and* it comes out in Lebanon (that's a big if), it will have dramatic effects I suspect on Lebanon, Hezbollah and the way Iran (as the controlling force behind Hezbollah) is seen throughout the region.

I'm curious what others think of the likelihood of this hypothesis and what you think the effect might be on Lebanon if this is discussed.

**TL;DR**: Since 2014, when the Ammonium Nitrate arrived in Beirut, Hezbollah has repeatedly supplied its global cells with large quantities of Ammonium Nitrate for intended attacks. I suspect that the Ammonium Nitrate in the port was allowed to remain there because it served a dual purpose as a weapons stockpile in a place where it could be easily and discretely shipped to potential targets."

The current turmoil in Belarus and its impact to Belarusian-Russian bilateral relations: A few points of consideration,1081,0.97,iajthp,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/iajthp/the_current_turmoil_in_belarus_and_its_impact_to/,75,2020-8-16,"Aleksandr Lukashenko was purportedly re-elected in Belarus's most recent elections.  The [current turmoil](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/world/europe/belarus-protests-guide.html) resulted.  As is fairly common in certain Eastern European elections, the 80% margin by which he claimed victory gives rise to obvious doubts as to legitimacy.  Mass protests and demonstrations resulted.  Lukashenko has 'won' past elections by similar margins, at least 85-90%+.  Lukashenko has arrested most of his political opponents, and jailed or exiled others.  Journalists which report on the extent of his corruption (of which there is no shortage) tend to find themselves in prison.  His title as Europe's so called 'last dictator' is well deserved.  

**The Global Response to Lukashenko's Purported Re-Election**

The global response to Lukashenko's purported re-election has been largely as would be anticipated.  Western countries -- and specifically the United States, through Mike Pompeo -- have expressed their reservations.  The results are self evidently suspect.  Despite this, Russia and China both endorsed the results and both countries have officially signaled their endorsement of the results.  Notably, Russia historically has been Belarus's strongest and closest ally, the animosity between Putin and Lukashenko in the recent years notwithstanding.   

**Uncertainty from Russia**

Despite the official endorsement from Putin, uncertainty remains as to the future of Russian and Belarusian bilateral relations.  Several prominent Russians, including those inside Putin's inner circle, have signaled that the Lukashenko's backing from Moscow is not guaranteed.  

Several developments this year contextualize the current status quo.  First, negotiations for discounted oil broke down in totality earlier in February 2020.  Russia not only suspended deliveries to Belarus, but offered future sales at ""[market rates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/world/europe/belarus-lukashenko-russia-putin.html)"" on a purely commercial basis.  Second, the oil negotiations broke down after Putin's proposal to merge the two countries was [flatly rejected](https://www.rferl.org/a/day-of-reckoning-as-pressure-mounts-belarusians-balk-at-prospect-of-russia-merger/30309691.html).  Natural gas sales were still discounted somewhat, but the lack of a market rate discount for oil sales to Belarus was a significant blow to the integrity of their relationship. 

The basic idea here is that when global oil prices were high, Russia could with very little significant loss discount its sales to Belarus to gain favor and geopolitical influence.  When oil prices bottomed out -- as they have in recent years -- the costs of that deal to Russia rose, so Russia sought to re-negotiate.  In the past, Lukashenko made few concessions (and in fact used the potential of closer ties with the West to extract that concession from Russia, consistent with his historical maneuvering of the animosity between Russia and NATO to his distinct advantage).  At the very least, Russia wanted closer economic (and by implication, political) integration; potentially, integration to the level of merging the two countries once Lukashenko left office.  Lukashenko predictably rebuked any such proposal. 

**Shrinking Russian Sphere of Influence**

From the outside looking in, it may not make sense why Russia would even want to integrate with Belarus.  All doubt however is resolved in consideration of how the other near and distant dominoes seem to be lining up -- each of them to fall outside the Russian sphere of influence.  Consider Kazakhstan, for example.  Nazarbayev (Kazakh president) has made deliberate efforts to broaden its economic and cultural reach outside the sphere of Russian influence, even to the point that he changed [the Kazakh alphabet](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41800186) from Cyrillic to Latin in 2017.   The idea was to draw a line in the sand relative to the scope and extent of Russian influence in Central Asia in general and Kazakhstan in particular. 

The fact that Russia hemorrhaged allied states following the USSR's collapse is a matter of historical record.  Thirteen Warsaw Pact countries have joined NATO.  So, when Georgia endeavored to join the EU in 2007, Putin invaded Abkhazia and South Ossetia -- both of which remain allegedly ""disputed"" territories to this day.   A [highly deceptive](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/HUDOC_38263_08_Annexes_ENG.pdf) analysis concluded Georgia was to blame; but the whole reason Russia invaded in the first place was because Georgia was actively seeking NATO membership -- of course, to prevent exactly such an invasion.  In reality, Russia invaded a sovereign country for the purpose of preventing it from joining NATO.  Putin's response shows that in Russia's analysis, Georgia is better as a fragmented state than a NATO ally or EU member.  

A similar pattern played out in Ukraine.  As I have discussed before, when Ukraine sought closer economic and political integration with Western Europe and the United States, that was met with Russian meddling in Ukraine's domestic politics, even to the point of installing Yanukovych as Russia's puppet Ukrainian president.  Thereafter, in the face of maidan, Putin invaded eastern Ukraine and seized Crimea.  In the example of Ukraine as in Georgia, the outcome shows that Russia would prefer that Ukraine be a failed or fragmented state than a NATO ally or EU member.  

Recall that the goal here was for Putin to create an economic alliance in at least Eastern Europe and Central Asia to rival the EU, and ideally as an insurance policy against further sanctions.  The first step in that process would be developing individualized economic integration projects among each of the former Soviet bloc states.  Instead, Putin lost Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Ukraine in the span of less than a decade.  Ukraine was the first such integration project -- and that resulted in then-president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych's absconding Ukraine for Russia in disgrace. 

**So is Belarus next?**

Perhaps.  It's a question worth asking; especially considering what ""being next"" could mean.  

In a first set of possible worlds, Lukashenko is out because of his own decisions, or because he is forced out (potentially by the protesters, Russia or both).  In 2018-2019, when Russian-Belarusian bilateral relations were at their worst, it's conceivable that Putin might have tried something like he achieved in Ukraine -- but highly unlikely.  

It isn't obvious that Putin would be unwilling invade, given in particular the fact that he invaded Georgia and Ukraine under somewhat similar circumstances and that at this moment Lukashenko is very weak.  Lukashenko has never faced mass protests/demonstrations of this caliber before.  Putin has, and he survived them, but the public's dissatisfaction with Lukashenko's ""leadership"" is amplified by the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus, the consequential economic fallout attributable to the world's response to the coronavirus, and an increasingly ravenous lion to the east in its once-closer ally Russia.  

This combination of factors certainly suggests that if Moscow sees the opportunity to try to replace Lukashenko with someone more reliable to the Kremlin, that is exactly what the Kremlin would try to accomplish.   In that situation, Moscow would be re-running the same play-book it ran to get Yanukovych elected as president of Ukraine.  Even if such a far-fetched plan were to work -- and it almost certainly would not, in the short term or the long term -- who would take Lukashenko's place?  There is no one that would not leave Moscow worse off than they would be with Lukashenko.  While it's obvious why he's not ideal, given the recent history of strife between the two countries, there is no world where Russia's interests are -- at this time -- served by trying to replace Lukashenko with a Kremlin puppet.  

In the second set of possible worlds, Lukashenko remains and has to quell or pacify the Belarusian political unrest while maintaining ground against increasing Russian pressure.  To accomplish this, Lukashenko could do something like seek a trade deal with the EU, as both Georgia and Ukraine did.  But that would almost certainly would involve some kind of military response from Russia, just like Georgia and then Ukraine.  While there's an argument to be made that Lukashenko's historically closer relationship with Russia (however complicated) insulates him from the kind of retaliation Putin visited upon Georgia and Ukraine, he would still be playing with fire.  The Russian response to that kind of a bargaining chip from Russia would likely not come in the form of unwillingness to discount oil; it would come in the same form as was witnessed in Eastern Ukraine.  To be clear, neither Putin nor Lukashenko benefit in that case.  

The remaining option is most likely:  Lukashenko ""cracks down"" on the protests, and then everything goes back to normal.  

**Why Belarus is Different from Ukraine & Georgia**

As I wrote before, Belarus is not Ukraine.  Maidan in Ukraine was in direct response to Ukrainian government's preventing Ukraine from joining the EU.  The Ukrainian government opted for a counter-agreement with Russia instead.  In response, Ukrainians took to the streets and sought Yanukovych's resignation.  He subsequently fled to Russia.  There were other abuses that precipitated the demonstrations, like Yanukovych arresting his pro-democracy political opponents and arresting journalists who were reporting on the extent of his corruption, but the threshold moment was when Yanukovych tried to rebuke the democratic will of the Ukrainian people (shirk the EU in favor of the Kremlin).  So, for Ukraine, the goal was a clear and decisive move towards the EU and the United States (and NATO, by implication).  This was in response to decades of Kremlin meddling in Ukrainian domestic political affairs.  Maidan there was Ukraine setting forth a future for itself that did not include Putin.  

Belarus also isn't Georgia.  The purported underlying ethnic conflict behind the Russian invasion of Georgia was little more than an illusory pretext; Saakashvili's primary aim for Georgia was to become a NATO member and there was clear support for that in the Bush Administration because of the implications that would have to world oil markets.  Specifically, despite the fact that Georgia has no reserves of its own, a pipeline across Georgia would substantially decrease Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil.  Bush even outlined a pathway for both Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO.  This was intolerable to Putin, and so he invaded as a result.  

Belarus and its present situation is almost wholly incongruous.  Belarus is now and has always been a far more authoritarian regime than Ukraine ever was, even at its worst.  Unlike Ukraine and Georgia, Belarus never made the initial step towards actual democracy that ultimately laid the foundation the Ukrainian maidan or the Georgian efforts to draw closer to the West.  Belarus also does not have ambitions of closer ties with the West, and the EU and Untied States in particular -- which Ukraine has sought for some time.  Lukashenko only ever used that as a bargaining chip to extract concessions from Moscow -- a fact of which Putin is invariably aware.  The riots taking place now in Belarus are not oriented towards any goal in particular, either.  It's arbitrary rage.  Even if they were oriented towards democratic reform, and it is not clear that they are, Belarus has no intention of divesting itself from the Russian sphere of influence -- however high the costs of maintaining that relationship may be.  

**Compromise / Cooperation best serve both Belarus's & Russia's Interests** 

If both Belarus and Russia act rationally, they will cooperate and compromise.  Russia will have little choice but to accept the fact that Belarus is not merging with Russia any time soon.  The costs of Russia's invading would be inexorably high.  There is no one in Belarusian politics that can replace Lukashenko that would be both able to preserve Belarus as a state and that would in the same instance be able to more effectively advance Moscow's interests.  Likewise, it is in Russia's interest that these riots and protests throughout Belarus come to and end -- as quickly and expeditiously as possible.  Political unrest in one totalitarian country has a tendency to spread to another; as Putin has experienced time and again, dating back to his time in Dresden through the present.  Further, this all comes at a time when Russian public confidence in Putin is at an all time low -- and the potential for another Moscow maidan (and perhaps one that might actually be successful) is at an all time high.  Given that, the more pertinent question in the final analysis might even be, if Lukashenko falls, is Putin next?  Their fates are tied together, whether they like it or not."

I answered this question on Quora and it got a modestly significant number of views (about 50 upvotes). but it got removed by moderation, I don't know why. Probably because it upset some Chinese nationalists/pro-Chinese Quorans (Lin Xieyi comes to mind). As we all know, Reddit is a liberal Western echo chamber so I suppose my views will find some resonance here.

I posted it on Quora because I think it's important to debunk some of the ill-informed and simplistic opinions about Singapore's foreign policy toward China. There are too many of those kinds of people voicing those opinions there. And I think too many of our people are not sufficiently educated on our foreign policy positions. This has to change if we are to be immunized against influence operations.

**I am neither pro-China nor anti-China. I am pro-Singapore.**

[https://www.quora.com/Do-Singaporeans-agree-with-the-ex-diplomat-that-China-is-exercising-influence-pressure-and-coercion-on-Singapore?q=do%20singpoareans%20agree%20with%20the%20ex-diplomat](https://www.quora.com/Do-Singaporeans-agree-with-the-ex-diplomat-that-China-is-exercising-influence-pressure-and-coercion-on-Singapore?q=do%20singpoareans%20agree%20with%20the%20ex-diplomat)

# Do Singaporeans agree with the ex-diplomat that China is exercising influence, pressure and coercion on Singapore?

At first I didn’t, or was undecided, but now I do.

If you are a PRC patriot, or are uncomfortable with speculation and insinuations, please stop reading now. It’s for your own good.

Let’s examine the source in question. Who was this “ex-diplomat”?

· Bilahari Kausikan was former Permanent Secretary of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs

· He has substantial experience in the foreign policy arena. I assume he might be privy to classified information which is withheld from our public.

· He is no longer a civil servant; he is a pensioner. As such, his views do NOT officially reflect those of the Singapore government.

· Despite this, his views hold substantial weight and are frequently published in the Straits Times (which, although not under direct govt control, toes the official line and operates under some form of para-state oversight)

· He has not been outright repudiated by other foreign policy elites (as was the case with Kishore Mahbubani). From this we may infer that his views resonate somewhat with the establishment, or our foreign policy orthodoxy

· There are some things which our government cannot publicly/officially state, out of prudence…by which I mean, complicating our relationships with certain powers

· It is possible that the government prefers to use “unofficial” means (such as retired civil servants) to clarify or rebut certain narratives

Now let’s examine the substance of his argument.

That China exercises influence, pressure and coercion on Singapore, is not surprising. What should be disturbing is the MEANS or the CHANNELS through which it deploys its influence. There are LEGITIMATE channels for interstate intercourse. These include diplomacy, state media, international aid etc. etc. It is entirely natural (whether it is fair or acceptable is a different debate) for Great Powers to leverage their superior political/economic/military resources to make smaller states comply with their wishes, whether through persuasion or coercion.

But Bilahari Kausikan’s concern is with the ILLEGITIMATE channels: covert influence operations. These are violations of Singapore’s sovereignty, albeit under the cover of plausible deniability. Influence operations fall under the purview of covert action, which is different from espionage - and far more insidious. Espionage seeks simply to steal information. Covert action is intended to **influence** events (for example, domestic politics or foreign policy) within a target nation-state to one’s own benefit

Now let me be clear: **All Great Powers conduct influence operations and espionage**. China is no exception. Neither is the US. And Singapore is not exempted from their attempts. Our response has been very even-handed.[Examples of foreign interference in the course of history and in Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/examples-of-foreign-interference-in-the-course-of-history-and-in-singapore)[An American diplomat once tried to influence the 1988 Singapore General Election](https://mothership.sg/2017/10/an-american-diplomat-once-tried-to-influence-the-1988-singapore-general-election/)[Singapore Protests U.S. 'Interference' After Diplomat Withdrawn](https://apnews.com/cc6ee41575dcc68a0403efb363e0a8a4)[Russia spy claims: US nabs Singapore centre research fellow](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/russia-spy-claims-us-nabs-spore-centre-research-fellow)

But this is not a valid excuse. People who employ this excuse are essentially saying “So what? everyone does it”. To quote the Chinese Ambassador’s response *“I would say firstly that every country hopes to gain recognition and support for its development philosophy and foreign policies. In this sense, China is no different.”* This is equivalent to arguing that wife-beating is acceptable, because many husbands beat their wives! The issue here is not that China or the US wants our support. The issue is the means by which they seek to procure our support.

American influence operations seek to impose a liberal-democratic ideology on Singapore. They are mostly ineffective because American notions of liberalism do not find much resonance among our public political consciousness. Nonetheless, these operations should be exterminated/neutralized whenever and wherever they are detected.

But **Chinese influence operations are more dangerous and insidious** because they **seek to impose a CHINESE identity on multiracial Singapore.** This is something much harder for our population to resist, particularly because **our national identity is so young and malleable. The appeals of ethnicity and culture are primordial and enduring.**

**SPECULATION ON CHINA’S 2016-2017 INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN**

In August, Huang Jing was exposed for giving *“supposedly ""privileged information"" to a senior member of the LKY School, so it could be passed on to the Singapore Government. The information was duly conveyed by that senior member of the LKYSPP to very senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore's foreign policy”.*

About 3 months later, LKYSPP Dean Kishore Mahbubani, who previously was a senior MFA diplomat (and presumably has contact with “very senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore’s foreign policy”), stepped down from his position. If you go on Youtube and watch the speeches and interviews he has been giving, he has become something of a hype-man advertising China’s rise.

I think we can put two and two together.

I do deeply respect Kishore Mahbubani. I think he is an intellectual worth reading and worth listening to. I have no doubt that he earnestly, sincerely believes in the views that he propounds. I definitely agree with many of his ideas about the rise of Asia and China. In fact, I will be buying his new book “Has China Won?”. But I also think some of his ideas regarding China lack nuance. Reality is often complex.

When Lin Xieyi speculated that Huang Jing was a US agent, this was Kausikan’s comment: *“This is the sort of stuff we must expect, intended to confuse the issue. Some of it will come from the seemingly neutral or well-meaning or the naive or from those whom Lenin used to call 'useful idiots'”*[Ambassador-at-large, Bilahari Kausikan, scoffs at Quora user questioning who Huang Jing is working for](https://mothership.sg/2017/08/ambassador-at-large-bilahari-kausikan-scoffs-at-quora-user-questioning-who-huang-jing-is-working-for/)

Kausikan shared more details on the Chinese influence campaign in this lecture, which I encourage all of you to watch:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw)

If you don’t have time, I’ll summarize (tl;dr skip to the bolded italics):

*When Singapore stood firm on its right to state its position on an issue of undoubted importance to us and to the region (South China Sea), the Chinese activated their influence apparatus and went into high gear to pressure the government - our government - to change position…*

*Not all influence operations pose the same degree of risk. The uniqueness of Beijing’s influence operations stems from China’s triple identities. And this prescribes three tracks on which China conducts its foreign policy and influence operations.*

*First, the PRC is a state like any other state, operating within a still largely Westphalian international order… On this first track of state-to-state relations, there’s nothing particularly unusual about what Beijing does, except the unusually assertive assertive behaviour of some Chinese diplomats of late, in countries as far-ranging as Malaysia, the PNG and Sweden.*

*Secondly, the PRC is not just any state, it’s also a Leninist state…and the characteristic modus operandi of a Leninist state is the United Front, which Mao Zedong called the CCP’s “magic weapon”… the main characteristic of a Leninist state is the total subordination of state and society to the interests of the Party, irrespective whether the Party’s interest is internal or external. And as such, the United Front represents a blurring of the distinction between domestic and foreign policies and a significant modification of the principle of non-interference that goes far beyond what is generally considered acceptable diplomatic practice.*

*Thirdly, the PRC is also a civilizational state: the embodiment and exemplar of millennia of the Chinese nation’s history and culture, now rejuvenated…and this identity as a civilizational state finds expression in the work of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office… In plain language, overseas Chinese should identify their interests with China’s interests and work to advance China’s interests. And this represents a deliberate blurring of the distinction made between the 华人 (ethnic Chinese) and the 华侨 (overseas PRC citizens)…*

*Now these 3 identities prescribe 3 tracks on which China conducts relationships. And taken holistically, they create a sophisticated and flexible instrument of influence that is far more effective than the conventional operations conducted by other countries. China’s influence operations are effective because the 3 tracks on which it operates makes it difficult to deal with or even grasp - even understand - in entirety.*

*On the first track of state-to-state relations, the usual tactics of persuasion, inducement or coercion may be deployed as appropriate, whether overtly through diplomacy or covertly through intelligence organizations. But the United Front may simultaneously operate to, for example, emphasize coercion or inducement even as the first track stresses persuasion. And the third civilizational track may conveniently wrap everything up in appeals to ethnic pride…Now the tendency of all governments and in particular foreign ministries is to focus on the first track of state-to-state relations and to want to keep them on an even keel…But this can all to easily lead to Chinese activities on the other two tracks being overlooked or downplayed.*

*\[the narrative of China’s absolute rise and America’s inevitable decline\] and others were* ***propagated by various means: WeChat with Chinese-speaking populations, social and mainstream media, whispering campaigns, business, clan and cultural associations, as well as conventional agents of influence reporting to Chinese intelligence organizations*** *who cultivate what Lenin called “useful idiots”.*

***It was difficult to pin down the precise origin of such narratives, but the messaging was to consistent, and too insistent, to be coincidental…many Singaporeans did not realize they were being fed oversimplifications and swallowed them whole or played along for other reasons. Businessmen, academics, and others with interests in China were given broad hints that their interests might suffer unless Singapore was more accommodating and passed the messages to the government…Appeals to ethnic pride were made to others. The aim was to instil a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability and desirability of a Chinese identity for multiracial Singapore and get Singaporeans to pressure the government to align Singapore’s interests with China’s interest.***

***In any case and for whatever reason, the 2016–2017 Chinese influence operation was effective. The pressures on the government were great.*** *It was very difficult to explain the somewhat abstract importance of UNCLOS or the nuances of our position on the South China Sea or the complications of our relationship with China to the general public, to whom the Chinese narratives were more easily understood. And* ***it cannot be denied that ethnic appeals resonated strongly with a probably not insignificant section of our public.***

***It’s clear enough for whom Huang Jing worked. I told you he had dual US-PRC citizenship. In case you don’t know, holding dual citizenship is forbidden in China. Huang Jing today holds a senior academic position in China, apparently without sanction for holding American citizenship.***

*As the only majority ethnic Chinese sovereign state in the region, Singapore is a special case. A majority Chinese Singapore that nevertheless conducts an independent foreign policy may be something of an anomaly in Chinese eyes.*

This is not the ravings of some conspiracy theorist. This is our former Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs speaking.

​

**STRATEGIC NARRATIVES**

What is a strategic narrative? A weaponized story.

In its influence campaigns against Singapore, the PRC advances a number of strategic narratives, all of which are, at best, questionable in their truthfulness. Sadly, some of our Singaporean Chinese compatriots sometimes buy into these narratives and even confidently echo them. Now, most of our population is only cursorily interested in foreign affairs and may find such superficial narratives plausible. This must change if they are to be immunized against these narratives.

This is a war of narratives. China cannot officially pressure us to choose sides. But they can paint a certain picture through unofficial channels and try to box us into a corner. They can try to tell us “See, this is what you are doing! Stop it!”. When they do that, we MUST push back by painting our own narratives and showing them that “no, actually we’re not doing that. We’re doing THIS”.

**MYTH 1. Surely as a “Chinese country”, Singapore should “explain” China’s position (on the South China Sea and other issues) to the rest of Southeast Asia**

**MYTH 2. China is rising and US is declining; therefore we should bandwagon with China. You should get on the right side of history!**

**MYTH 3. If you are not with China, then you are against China! You are an American puppet/proxy, or, if you are ethnic Chinese, even worse - a race traitor!**

**MYTH 4. Singapore has no claims in the South China Sea, and purports to be a neutral/non-aligned country so why is it “taking sides” with the US against China by agreeing with the PCA ruling and hosting US naval assets?**

**MYTH 5. Unlike Lee Kuan Yew, the current PAP leadership under Lee Hsien Loong doesn’t know how to deal with China. Relations were sooooo much better under LKY.**

Let me proceed to puncture each of these myths in turn, with great pleasure.

**MYTH 1:** We are NOT a “Chinese country”. We are a country that happens to have a majority ethnic-Chinese population that organizes itself on the basis of multiracialism/multiculturalism. This has been fundamental to Singapore’s identity since the days of Lee Kuan Yew, and this is something we must always remember, no matter how many times we are accused of being “race traitors” by our mainland friends. When the PRC tries to impose a “Chinese” identity on multiracial Singapore, we MUST resist.

Yes, we share ties with mainland Chinese on the basis of blood and culture. This ethnocultural kinship should be celebrated, not denied (as in the case of some HKers). Our similar cultural programming allows us to understand the Chinese mindset in some respects, to “empathize” with it.

But it does not mean we should unreservedly parrot China’s claims to the rest of Southeast Asia. As country coordinator for ASEAN-China relations, our job is to uphold ASEAN centrality; to represent the interests of ASEAN, of our REGION, in dealing with China. It is not to represent China’s interests in dealings with ASEAN. We have no obligation, moral or otherwise, to advocate or support China’s interests. Understanding them is one matter. Supporting them is another. The two are not mutually irreconcilable, but they must be distinguished.

**MYTH 2:** This myth, like many other myths, has a grain of truth to it. It is very ably represented by the speeches and works of Professor Kishore Mahbubani, our former ambassador and an intellectual whom I admire very much. Unfortunately, it is also extremely oversimplified and ignores many problematic nuances.Indeed, China is rising and has been for quite a while. You would have to be blind to deny that. But China’s rise is not going to be linear; it is going to be a long, winding, and fluctuating road. China has many internal structural problems of its own to deal with. From the way some people talk about China in juxtaposition to the West, it makes it sound like the Chinese are strategic masterminds while the Westerners are a bunch of bumbling idiots. Like I said, grain of truth, but grossly oversimplistic. It ignores many of the US’ intrinsic strengths and some of China’s structural challenges.

China is rising, but America is NOT in decline, except in relative terms. Militarily it is still pre-eminent in the Asia-Pacific. Its military dominance is receding and will continue to recede in time, as the PLA Navy becomes stronger. China is becoming more and more economically central to our region and the world; depending on which index of measurement you use (GDP PPP, GDP per capita, absolute GDP) it may have already eclipsed the US economy. China is pushing the frontiers of cutting-edge technology like 5G. This process is inevitable.

But what is not inevitable is the outcome of China displacing the US as regional or global superpower. This is an outcome that is FAR from certain. It is still too early to tell. The only thing we can say for now is that the regional strategic equation will become more and more symmetrical over time. As with buying new stocks/shares on the financial market, it is too early to count our chickens before they are hatched. Some views on China’s rise (Mahbubani’s included) tend to take the Whig view of history - “up and up and on and on”

The Chinese never tire of reminding us that China’s presence in Asia is a permanent geographic fact, while America’s presence is the product of a political calculation. This implies both enhanced threat and opportunity for the rest of East Asia (be nice to us, because you have to live with us for the rest of eternity). And that is true - what is our Plan B if America withdraws from the region? Without America, the balance of power in Asia cannot be maintained. But again, this myth is too simplistic. America’s presence in Asia is not as fragile as the Chinese would like us to think.

Asia is burgeoning with growth. In the next few decades the economic center of gravity is going to shift toward the Asia-Pacific. America has an interest in retaining access to this region, in economic and military terms. I do agree that China cannot be contained - it is so interdependent with America that America might as well try to contain itself as to contain China. But we should not underestimate the degree to which America has integrated and committed itself to the Asia-Pacific.

**MYTH 3:** This one I find the most ludicrous and at the same time the most hilarious. Just because I disagree with China’s stance on a SPECIFIC, SINGLE issue means that I must have been brainwashed by western media into being an anti-China dog? Hahahaha.

This is what is known as a false dichotomy. It is powerful because these dichotomies do exist, but they are a spectrum rather than a binary choice of A or B. China posits an illusory binary between itself and the West, and forces you to choose between them. If you are not A, then you must be B and ONLY B and nothing else. Substitute A and B with pro-China and pro-US, pro-CCP and pro-democracy, blah blah blah. You get the idea. This ignores all the nuances in between.

This myth is also the most insidious and dangerous one because it denies the existence of AGENCY on the part of small states. It denies that small states can ever act autonomously -that anything that we do must be driven by the hidden hand of Great Power competition.

Singapore’s policy can be characterized as strategic hedging. I will admit we lean slightly toward low-intensity “soft” balancing against China, but it is still more nuanced than “hard” balancing against China and “hard” bandwagoning with the US.

By the way, Singapore is not the only country practicing a hedging strategy. Duterte has recently taken to flirting with China; I don’t blame him, I think it’s a smart move. But he has also increased cooperation with Japan, and he has not abolished the alliance Treaty which formally commits the US to defend the Philippines in wartime. Thailand has grown closer toward China as well, buying Chinese tanks, but it is still a US ally. Even Myanmar: when Myanmar realized in the 2000s and early 2010s that it was growing more and more dependent on Chinese investment, infrastructure etc., what did it do? It initiated a rapprochement with the Obama Administration. Malaysia under Mahathir began to reassess a number of Chinese infrastructure projects in light of its indebtedness to China. The American 7th Fleet still calls at Malaysian ports. Vietnam is probably leaning even further toward the Balancing end of the spectrum than Singapore - the very existence of Vietnam as an independent entity is predicated on thousands of years of resisting subordination to China.

So, fellow Singaporeans, do not believe that we are alone in playing this delicate game of power-balancing. That is what China wants you to believe: that we are acting alone and inadvertently as a US proxy, when in reality we are making calculated choices to minimize risk and maximize gain.

**MYTH 4:** Yes, Singapore is a non-claimant state. We have no territorial claims in the South China Sea and we take no position on the claims of Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, China etc. But what we do have is an interest in FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION in the South China Sea (enshrined in international law, namely UNCLOS). We want our merchant ships carrying our imports and exports to be able to transition the South China Sea freely. Trade is the lifeblood of our free and open economy.

Now, some mainland Chinese might argue that China has not explicitly threatened the right of freedom of navigation in the area. They are right. China has not demanded we pay a toll or tariff for passing through the area, not yet anyway. Hopefully it never does. But China’s behavior of creating and militarizing artificial islands in the South China Sea has not exactly inspired confidence on the part of Southeast Asian states regarding its future behavior.

And in case you think our statement on the PCA’s verdict was somehow “extreme” or “new”, let me read out the statement to you:

>*Singapore has taken note of the Award made by the Arbitral Tribunal convened under Annex VII to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) on 12 July 2016 on the case between the Republic of the Philippines and the People’s Republic of China. We are studying the Award and its implications on Singapore and the wider region.*  
*Singapore is not a claimant state and we do not take sides on the competing territorial claims. However, we support the peaceful resolution of disputes among claimants in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including Unclos, without resorting to the threat or use of force. As a small state, we strongly support the maintenance of a rules-based order that upholds and protects the rights and privileges of all states.*  
*Singapore values our long-standing and friendly relations with all parties, bilaterally and in the context of Asean. We urge all parties to fully respect legal and diplomatic processes, exercise self-restraint and avoid conducting any activities that may raise tensions in the region.*  
*Singapore supports the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the expeditious conclusion of a legally binding Code of Conduct in the South China Sea*

In other words, we did NOT even explicitly SUPPORT the ruling of the PCA in favor of the Philippines. We simply positively acknowledged the ruling and said that international law is important and we should all respect it. Can that be any less provocative? How could this be construed in any way as “taking sides”? Are the Chinese really so thin-skinned that they object to us even SPEAKING about the SCS issue?

Let me remind you that the PCA was the same court that ruled in favor of our dispute with Malaysia over Pedra Branca. So what would the implication be if we supported the PCA ruling for ourselves, but turned a blind eye to its ruling over the SCS? International law for me, but not for thee?

Note also that Singapore was not alone: Vietnam, Myanmar, and Malaysia also positively acknowledged or outright supported the ruling of the PCA. Why did we deserve to be singled out for coercion?

Non-alignment/neutrality is a PREFERENCE. It is not a solution. Singapore cannot prosper and be secure simply by pursuing a “hiding” strategy of laying low and hoping not to be noticed. I will be happy to elaborate if you disagree. We host the US military because we consider it productive to our security interests (and that of regional security) for America to maintain a regional presence. This is to provide a counterweight to China and give us strategic space to maneuver. It is NOT to contain China or obstruct its rise.

And while we are on the subject, we should note that the US military only maintains a purely rotational presence in Singapore. There are NO permanent US military bases or assets stationed here. The naval base which their aircraft carrier uses belongs to us. We should also further note that Singapore has NO formal treaty of alliance with America. In fact it is rumored that in 2003 America offered us the status of a major non-NATO ally - a formal security commitment from the US to defend Singapore…and we rejected them. Now, is that how we would behave if we were really American proxies?

*“I am non-aligned in the sense that I do not want to be involved in power blocs…but when my security, Singapore’s survival, Singapore’s prosperity is threatened, I cannot be neutral”* \- Lee Kuan Yew

*“Singapore has to take the world as it is, it is too small to change it. But we can try to maximise the space we have to maneuver among the big ‘trees’ in the region”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013

**MYTH 5:** Kishore claimed that *“now that LKY is no longer with us, we should change our behaviour significantly…we should be very restrained in commenting on matters involving Great Powers”*. I agree with him that we should be circumspect, pragmatic, even cold-blooded, when it comes to dealing with Great Powers. We must tread carefully.

But has there been any fundamental change in Singapore’s policy toward China post-LKY? No. Our relationship with the US goes back to the 1990s. Likewise with China we have always (and I emphasize, we CONTINUE to) promote the engagement of China with the region and the world. China must come to terms with the world order, just as the world order must accommodate China.

The Chinese like to grumble about the good old days of LKY and how well he got along with them. Again, they are not wrong. But this is a form of historical cherry-picking, of selective memory. Remember that LKY was one of the only Asian leaders to go up against a CCP-backed communist united front and win. Remember also that Mao’s China issued frequent propaganda proclamations labelling him a “running dog” of the West.

Lee Kuan Yew’s views on China were not one-dimensional. They were complex and nuanced. They were tactful, yes, but honest and direct. He did not shy away from political incorrectness.

>*“The Chinese may make a miscalculation…they may become assertive and pushy, which is contrary to their long-term interest, which is to win over the smaller countries in the south to their side”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, 2011  
*“\[My uncle-in-law\] had this romantic idea that, you know, \[China\] is a land of my forefathers. I have no doubts that the land of my forefathers would have brought me down in the world…They (the Chinese) wanted me to contribute \[to my uncle-in-law’s manor house which the Chinese refurbished and made into a historic tourist site\]. I said no, no, I’m not Chinese, I’m Singaporean, I’m not going to visit the place…I have no romantic view about where I sprang from. I’m very grateful that my great grandmother who was born here decided she’s not going to go back (to China) with her husband because she doesn’t know China…I’m a lucky fellow. Yes, we are all lucky fellows. But the older generation has this romantic idea…I discovered when I was a student in England, that I had more in common with the Singaporeans and Malaysians of other races than with the Chinese from China because they are completely different. Their dress, their manners, their language. They are a different lot, that’s all. They come from a different society. Of course, at the end of the day they are Chinese.”* \-Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011  
*“That romantic idea of going back to the bosom of your motherland is a delusion. We have become different, that’s all. You can go back to China, you’re still different…If you go to China, I don’t think you will belong. They’ll say okay, we’ll accept you. But look at even the Malayan communist cadres who sent their families and children there…- nevertheless, they were treated differently…You think you’re Chinese , and that you will blend in, but you will not. You are already different. We are already different. Just like the American and the British people, or for that matter, the South African whites, Australians, New Zealanders and the British. The Taiwanese mainlanders and Chinese mainlanders, who have not stayed in Taiwan, yes, they are same stock, same heritage, but had different exposure, different standpoints, different views of the world. Are we Chinese? Yes, ethnically. Can we sit down with the Chinese and really feel part of them? Not possible. Because you speak Chinese? No. Your major premises are in your mind” - Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011*  
*“\[The Chinese\] expect us to be more respectful - you must respect me. They tell us countries big or small are equal, we’re not a hegemon, 不称霸. But when we do something they don’t like, they say you have made 1.3 billion people unhappy … So please know your place”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011  
*“I do not see Singapore surviving on the Chinese economy. If we spoke only Chinese, we would not be today’s Singapore. What is the difference if China is ten times stronger? It will make us ten times stronger? No. Our prosperity comes from linkages with the world…the future is the same. We are not Hainan Island. We are not Hong Kong, where they have no choice. We are in the centre of an archipelago of great diversity, with rich natural resources, and the world will come here”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“How can \[the Chinese object to the American logistics hub here\]? That is crude. If they ask us to stop the logistics base, our answer would be: you can use the logistics base and store your equipment here (so we would host both the Chinese and Americans”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“Singapore is quite comfortable with the Americans being present. We do not know how brash or assertive China will become. When I said in 2009 that we must balance China, they translated the word in Chinese into ‘conscribe’, and there was a big uproar among their netizens, who asked how dare I say that when I am Chinese. They are hypersensistive”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“You have to accept the fact that they (China) are the biggest boy in the neighbourhood. They will not be the biggest in the Pacific because the US will always be there to counterbalance them. But increasingly, they would be able to keep the US away from the coastal regions. That’s a development we have to accept. No more \[uncomfortable for Singapore\] than for the other countries…It’s even more tricky for Vietnam. We have no conflict of interest with China…we have no such overlapping claims with them.”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013

**CONCLUSION**

Let me emphasize again: I see the rise of China as a good thing in the long-term. It is not an ABSOLUTE good, but it is good. China is a FRIEND, even if friends can be pushy at times and we do not always agree with our friends about everything all the time. Singapore and China have no fundamental clash of core interests. Indeed, I think it is possible for our core interests to align with China. Not only with China, but also with the US, India, Japan, etc. Whether or not it aligns with China to a greater degree than with other powers is to be seen, and in large part decided, by China’s own behaviour.

But in any case if there is alignment, our lodestar must always be our NATIONAL INTEREST - Singapore’s own national interest - determined by Singaporeans’ own choices ALONE and no one else’s, undiluted by the manipulation of ANY foreign entity. And in case you think I’m only referring to China, go look at our handling of the 1988 Hendrickson Affair.

Huang Jing was only one manifestation of this. **Foreign powers will continue to attempt to influence our policy. When they stick their fingers into our sovereign discursive space, we must continue to quietly, tactfully, but ruthlessly** ***slice those fingers off.***

Opinion: China's Rising Racism May Substantially Harm Its Own Globalization,1048,0.87,fz2oh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/fz2oh3/opinion_chinas_rising_racism_may_substantially/,91,2020-4-11,"During this stage of Covid-19 crisis, when China has mostly have the virus outbreak under control while the other countries are still suffering from it, the fear of a second wave caused by imported cases have raised xenophobic sentiment across the Chinese internet. And the racism that has been rooted into Chinese society for a long time is now rising again, brought up by this trend of xenophobia. This is particularly worrisome from a Chinese perspective, because the rising xenophobia/racism will inevitably harm China's image as a leading globalization promoter and thus hinder it from gaining more influence and support from the rest of the world, which is essential for a world superpower. 

Recently one of the most controversial news in China is that, [a Nigerian man carrying coronavirus attacked a nurse](https://shanghai.ist/2020/04/02/nigerian-coronavirus-patient-attacks-nurse-in-guangzhou-hospital/) in Guangzhou. Also, in Qingdao, [three Americans allegedly cut in a coronavirus testing line and shouted ""Chinese get out""](https://supchina.com/2020/04/01/three-americans-get-heat-for-cutting-in-a-covid-19-testing-line-in-qingdao-local-government-apologizes-on-their-behalf/). These became the top news in China. While these foreigners are definitely guilty and should be blamed, it quickly developed to the blame on the whole group of foreigners. Here comes the [cartoon](https://supchina.com/2020/04/06/chinese-cartoon-depicts-rule-breaking-foreigners-as-trash-to-be-sorted/) that depicted rule-breaking foreigners as trash to be disposed. While the producer of the cartoon specifies that he only targets the rule-breaking ones, the xenophobic and racist sentiment is clearly growing.

In 1980s, 90s and 2000s, Chinese people give foreigners a lot of respects, maybe too much, to a state that they almost ""worship"" foreigners, giving the situation that China was so poor and technologically backwards compared the West. Also, for a long time Chinese government officials care a lot about its image in front of foreigners, and thus always provide the foreigners better service than other Chinese nationals.  This has triggered great anger among younger Chinese people, specifically the Millennials and Gen-Zs. It's good to ask for equal treatment, but the trend, in my opinion, has gone too far that the situation is gradually becoming the opposite.

Since Chinese Internet has always been relatively isolated from the rest of the world due to many reasons (language barrier, the great firewall, etc.) it will be appalling for a foreigner to browse the Chinese major websites like Weibo, Tieba, etc. They are filled with disparaging terms for foreigners: 鬼子/Ghost for the Japanese, 棒子/Stick-holder for the Korean, 猴子/Monkey for Southeast Asian, 阿三/Ahsir for Indian, 毛子/Fur-man (synonym for bandit in some local dialects) for Russian, 白皮猪/White-skin Pig for Caucasian, 黑鬼/Black Ghost for black people, etc. Although in other languages there are insulting terms of similar meaning as well, my point is these words are used so widespread in China that they are literally everywhere on the Internet. Some people even replace the normal wording with these words, and use them even if they don't mean to insult anyone. In the West people have at least learned to hide the racist sentiment, but in China many people have no conscientious scruples and use the disparaging terms on a daily basis.

One of the most confusing points my fellow Chinese netizens make when I tried to confront them on racism is, Americans and Europeans have such anti-racist laws and regulations as an expiation for the black people of the past slavery history. Since China didn't enslave the black people, China doesn't ""owe"" them anything and thus there's no need to establish an anti-racist social norm.

China has always been an advocator of globalization for long, given that China's growth relies a lot on FDI in the past and now China is also investing tonnes of money around the world. However, Chinese leaders are also keen on fostering national pride in recent years, which is easily transformed to racial pride given China is very homogenous overall. It's good to teach your kids not to feel inferior in front of foreigner and know your strength, but you also need to teach them to respect others and stop generalizing a group using a few badass. To sustain its position of leading advocator/promoter of globalization, China should really learn to achieve a balance.

The US/China conflict is likely to escalate in the future.

I support free markets, free speech and democracy. The PRC/CCP lacks the legitimacy of its people and represents the greatest threat to personal freedoms and individual liberties around the world since the USSR. As with all totalitarian regimes it is deeply insecure, vindictive, coercive, and values its own survival more than the lives of it citizens. 

#Growing bipartisanship 

There is a large and growing bipartisan consensus within the United States government and Congress that it’s relationship with the PRC has become hostile, [and that it’s aggressive and coercive policies need to be checked](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/articles/chinese-non-military-coercion-tactics-and-rationale/amp/). Based on how the American government is talking it looks as if they are going to retaliate against Beijing once corona is over. I think you’re going to see a massive coordinated retaliation against the CCP and it’s interests by the whole of the American government. 

#Superpower rivalry 

The current US/China power struggle (or as some call it coldwar 2.0) is often portrayed as a battle between two superpowers but that really couldn’t be further from the truth. The PRC, just like the USSR, has never met the criteria to be called a superpower, at best it’s a strong regional power. At its peak the USSR economy was 60-65% the size of the US, China’s is closer to 60% today [(the CCP has inflated its GDP figures for decades)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-08/china-s-gdp-growth-pace-was-inflated-for-nine-years-study-finds) So even in relative terms it’s not as powerful a rival overall as the Soviet Union was.

> A superpower is a state with a dominant position characterized by its extensive ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale. This is done through the combined means of economic, military, technological and cultural strength as well as diplomatic and soft power influence. Traditionally, superpowers are preeminent among the great powers.

[In terms of overall wealth the US dwarfs China](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html) and produces more wealth each year than China does. 

> The US, China, and Europe contributed the most towards global wealth growth with USD 3.8 trillion, USD 1.9 trillion and USD 1.1 trillion respectively. 

The media likes to portray everything as black and white so this “superpower rivalry” narrative has taken hold but it portrays china as much more powerful and influential than it actually is. Under all the propaganda and strongman talk the CCPs regime has become very brittle and non responsive. And it’s incredibly vulnerable to US political, military and economic pressure. 

[China’s entire economic foundation is build on a system dependent on access to US dollars](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2173461/china-underestimating-its-us3-trillion-dollar-debt-and-could), China keeps massive USD foreign reserves because that’s what backstops its own currency. [If it was so easy to ween off USD they would’ve done it decades ago](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/18/chinas-dangerous-dollar-addiction/). Instead the opposite has happened, the US dollar is more dominate today than it was before the Great Recession. So much so that central bank governors like Mark Carney have warned that corona virus has likely made the worlds dependence on USD a permanent fixture because there’s no viable alternative. 

The threat of dumping treasuries is a bluff, it would be significantly more damaging to China than to America. All the Fed would have to do is buy them as the PBOC sells them. China comes out no further ahead but does incredible damage to its own economy. 

#What if the US was as coercive as China? 

Take a second and imagine a world where the US was as coercive in its foreign policy as the PRC. If it (or any other nation) didn’t do as told all America would have to do is announce it’s cutting china’s access to dollars and [overnight the entire banking and financial system would become insolvent](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1UD0KD). I doubt this scenario would ever play out because the cascading effect would be devastating to other Asian economies. But it demonstrates one of the many policy tools America can use to bludgeon the PRC if it needed to. It’s very under appreciated how many knives America has on china’s jugular. 

#In conclusion 

This struggle is by no means a contest between two equal powers, the PRC is dominated by the US in almost every domain and has likely hit its high water mark as the unsustainable debt load, inefficiencies and demographic crises begins to strangle it long term. Aside from coercion China lacks any real soft or hard power beyond economic clout.

 The agreement, also for the first time in India-China rules of engagement, makes it clear that “neither side shall open fire or conduct blast operations within 2 km of the Line of Actual Control”.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Statement: Indian and Chinese troops have disengaged at the Galwan area where they had earlier clashed on the night of 15/16 June 2020. 17 Indian troops who were critically injured in the line of duty at the stand off location and exposed to sub-zero temperatures in the high altitude terrain have succumbed to their injuries, taking the total that were killed in action to 20.Indian Army is firmly committed to protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the nation.

Also Chinese troops erected an observation post on the Indian side of the LAC, which has now been removed.

Earlier ANI (a trustworthy news agency) stated:“Indian intercepts reveal that Chinese side suffered 43 casualties including dead and seriously injured in face-off in the Galwan valley""~ sources confirm to ANI

Also some sources said that Chinese side might never reveal the numbers, to avoid comparison and escalation of tensions between India and China.

Ministry of external affairs (indian side) earlier replied to media queries:

* India and China have been discussing through military and diplomatic channels the de-escalation of the situation in the border area in EasternLadakh.

* Senior Commanders had a productive meeting on 6th June 2020 and agreed on a process for such de-escalation. Subsequently, ground commanders had a series of meetings to implement the consensus reached at a higher level.

* While it was our expectation that this would unfold smoothly, the Chinese side departed from the consensus to respect the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Galwan Valley.

* On the late-evening and night of 15th June, 2020 a violent face-off happened as a result of an attempt by the Chinese side to unilaterally change the status quo there. Both sides suffered casualties that could have been avoided had the agreement at the higher level been scrupulously followed by the Chinese side.

* Given its responsible approach to border management, India is very clear that all its activities are always within the Indian side of the LAC. We expect the same of the Chinese side.

* We remain firmly convinced of the need for the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas and the resolution of differences through dialogue. At the same time, we are also strongly committed to ensuring India's sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

Update :

* Indian Army has been given emergency power to deal with complete freedom against any Chinese aggression at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

* India begins stocking up its war reserves. Fighters, warships moved to forward bases after bloodiest day in Ladakh.

* the Indian Navy has also been given the go-ahead to deploy its assets near the Malacca Strait and, if needed, anywhere else in the Indo-Pacific to counter Chinese action.

* Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Galwan Valley clashes “The sovereignty of the Galwan valley area has always belonged to China. The Indian border troops flip-flopped and seriously violated our border protocols on border-related issues and the consensus of our commander level talks,"" Zhao Lijian, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson

* India's Prime Minister issues statement:

""I would like to assure the nation that the sacrifice of our jawans will not be in vain. For us, the unity and sovereignty of the country is the most important. India wants peace but it is capable to give a befitting reply if instigated"": PM Modi (statement was in Hindi, this is a translation)

* EAM (Ext. affairs minister) S Jaishankar underlined that this unprecedented development will have a serious impact on the bilateral relationship. The need of the hour was for the Chinese side to reassess its actions and take corrective steps: MEA

* What happened in Galwan was premeditated and planned action by China which was responsible for the sequence of events: Message conveyed by foreign minister to China

Latest Updates:

* India late on Wednesday reacted on the statement by the Chinese side that the sovereignty of the Galwan valley area belongs to China. ""Making exaggerated and untenable claims is contrary to this understanding,"" a statement by the Ministry of External Affairs read with reference to its earlier statement on both sides agreeing to handle the situation ""in a responsible manner"".
In response to a query on the statement by the Chinese side that the sovereignty of the Galvan valley area belongs to China, the Official Spokesperson Mr. Anurag Srivastava said,"" As we have conveyed earlier today External Affairs Minister and the State Councillor and Foreign Minister of China had a phone conversation on recent developments in Ladakh. Both sides have agreed that the overall situation should be handled in a responsible manner and that the understandings reached between Senior Commanders on 6th June should be implemented sincerely. Making exaggerated and untenable claims is contrary to this understanding.""

* Major-General level talks fail to break deadlock: A fresh round of talks Wednesday at the level of Major Generals after Monday’s violent faceoff between Indian and Chinese soldiers failed to break the deadlock between the two sides, with the meeting ending on an inconclusive note. This was the second meeting in two days between GOC 3 Division and his Chinese counterpart at PP14 on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Tuesday’s meeting had resulted in bringing down tensions in the area which had been running high following the violent faceoff which led to the death of 20 soldiers. 

* Villages close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) where the confrontation between the Indian and Chinese soldiers took place are “completely cut off from communication”, the Chief Executive Councillor of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) told The Indian Express on Wednesday.
The authorities “have not been able to reach local councillors there as well,” Gyal P Wangyal said. The LAHDC, Leh, is the key governing body of the Ladakh region.

* US, EU and UN call for peaceful resolution of Ladakh situation: In response to a query, a US State Department spokesperson said, “Both India and China have expressed a desire to de-escalate, and we support a peaceful resolution of the current situation,” adding that the US is “closely monitoring the situation between Indian and Chinese forces along the Line of Actual Control.” EU spokesperson Virginie Battu-Henriksson said in a statement that India and China should show restraint and engage in military de-escalation, as well as continue their dialogue.

"Some thoughts on Xi Jinping as ""emperor for life"" as China turns 70",904,0.97,daxrqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/daxrqp/some_thoughts_on_xi_jinping_as_emperor_for_life/,160,2019-9-30,"As the PRC turns 70 on October 1st this coming Tuesday, there are a handful of recurrent political questions I've seen in the subreddit over the last year that bridge the discussion between domestic Chinese politics and China related geopolitics. I think one of the most prevalent questions are the prospects of Xi Jinping as ""emperor for life"".

By now, everyone knows that China removed presidential term limits in 2018, allowing Xi to preside as president for more than two terms. Many news media, commentators and commenters have suggested this would enable Xi to be ""emperor for life"". However there are also more than a few individuals that correctly point out that the true seat of power isn't the president of China but rather in the general secretary of the CCP which does not have term limits.

That is to say, in theory, Xi could retain his seat as general secretary (as well as other positions that he holds) and give up the role of president to someone else and still retain much of his power. But doing so would obviously lead to a degree of awkwardness not only in terms of perceiving which titles have how much power, but also in terms of the internal division of power within the CCP and Chinese government.

Jiang and Hu served about 10 years each (""two presidential terms"" equivalent) as paramount leaders of China. What can be inferred from the abolishing of term limits is that Xi almost certainly will stay on as China's paramount leader for more than ""two presidential terms"" (aka 10 years). The big questions which follow, are -- *will he be ""emperor for life,"" and ""why does Xi need or want to be paramount leader for more than 10 years*? I have my own take on these two questions, which are actually dovetailed quite closely to each other.

* ***Will Xi be emperor for life?*** \-- I personally consider such a prospect to be unlikely. The CCP are many things, but they do not tend to miss the big glaring warning signs in China's own history. The time of Mao and the many Chinese emperors in respective dynasties should be more than enough proof to the CCP that allowing a leader to serve **literally until they die** is a recipe for disaster, as the leader becomes more senile, cognitively impaired and progressively less able to effectively discharge their duties. Now, one could suggest that perhaps Xi had become so powerful that he was able to corral and force the entire CCP to capitulate to allow him to become ""emperor for life"" against their will. But if that were true, then I believe we would be seeing Xi throw his individual power around in China much more than we are -- i.e.: it would be approaching Mao levels of power at his peak. IMO it is much more likely that granting Xi the consent for him to govern for more than 10 years was a collective CCP decision in some form.
* ***Why does Xi need or want to be leader for more than 10 years?*** \-- The most common answer to this question I've seen thrown around in news media and commentators is that Xi is power hungry, seeking to solidify his authoritarian position against enemies, and the general idea that he is seeking power for the sake of power. While I think such a possibility cannot be ruled out, I also think it is a bit simplistic and seems to come from individuals and groups who were critiques of Xi to begin with. I have an alternative answer to this question, which ties it in with China's place in the world and the evolving geopolitical situation which China faces. Basically, I believe that Xi (and to a degree, the CCP overall) views the early to late 2020s as a potentially ""dangerous time"" in China's future.
   * This is a period in which the Chinese GDP is projected to start to come within a stone's throw distance of the US GDP (nominal terms), as well as a period in which the political status of Taiwan might undergo upheaval depending on the political party in power in Taiwan during the period (and we all know that the political status of Taiwan is very much tied with the possibility of military conflict). Chinese military capability will also likely be further advanced and greater in magnitude by this period, with capability gaps with foreign competitors closing the gap further from today. The US is almost certainly going to further engage in great power geopolitical and geoeconomic competition on multiple fronts as well.
   * In terms of geopolitics/geoeconomics, I believe the early 2020s to late 2020s is a period where the potential for conflict and threat to China's future development and growth trajectory is greatest. Many people speak of the Thucydides trap, and while it is not a perfect term, for the purposes of discussion, I believe the early 2020s-late 2020s is when the risk of the ""trap"" is the greatest. In other words, I think the early 2020s-late 2020s will be a potentially decisive period of time where China's medium and long term future can be ""made or broken"". A few users in this sub have mentioned this as well, and a few Chinese strategic commentators in the past have alluded to this (though I cannot recall the exact links to the interviews or comments).
   * If Xi had 10 years (aka two presidential term equivalents) as paramount leader of China, it means he would be handing over power to a successor around 2022 -- i.e.: right as this ""decisive period"" begins. I believe that the CCP may have desired a more continuous sustainment of policy and a more experienced leader for this period, and recognized that having a transition of power could be dangerous to Chinese national interests and present a geopolitical risk.
   * A comparison could be made to Deng, who was in many ways paramount leader of China from 1978 to 1992 (14 years) and whose leadership conducted the massive course correction and created the foundations of China's economic growth in subsequent decades under Jiang and Hu. Xi has the equally gargantuan task of ensuring China's geopolitical stability and survival, as well as to create a foundation for China's future geopolitical growth in the future -- such a task would likely not be achievable within merely 10 years of power (not to mention, the beginning and end of a 10 year leadership era is marked by a ""lame duck""/transitory period meaning 10 years of leadership is more like \~8 years of actual active leadership).

With all the above said, I do have a few caveats:

1. I think removing presidential term limits does present a potential longer term risk down the road; i.e.: it opens the door to future leaders seeking to maintain power for the sake of power and result in an ""emperor for life"" situation when the situation did not demand it.
2. What I wrote above is very much coming from an underlying ""assumption"" that the CCP and Xi are rational actors and that Xi himself is not seeking to ""gain power for the sake of power"" alone. There are many people who believe that Xi may seek to gain power for the sake of power alone for various reasons such as seeking to ensure his own survival or simply because they perceive Xi to be of an authoritarian or power hungry nature inherently. As written above, I acknowledge this as a non-zero possibility, but I think immediately deferring to this assumption without considering alternatives is potentially dangerous or at least a bit intellectually lazy.
3. For the record, Xi most definitely has consolidated power much more than his predecessors Jiang and Hu had done. But there's been much talk that he is the most powerful leader in China ""since Mao"" which I think is a wild exaggeration considering the things Mao was able to do unilaterally during the peak of his power. I would argue that Xi is the most powerful leader since Deng -- but of course the connotations of comparing Xi with Deng and comparing Xi with Mao are rather different to your average reader.
4. Also, it goes without saying that there are definitely still some factions and individuals in the CCP who would be opposed to Xi for various reasons or another. I'm sure some of them would be happy to impede certain aspects of Xi's domestic agenda and see him taken down a few notches. But in terms of the big picture I don't see the kind of hidden institutional discontent in the CCP that has been claimed by some foreign commentators.

My projection for the most likely course of Xi's leadership -- he remains in power until \~2027. I.e.: he serves 3 ""presidential term"" equivalents. Afterwards he will step down and a transition of power will occur most likely to someone from the ""[7th generation](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/China-People-s-Congress/China-grooms-Xi-s-successor-skipping-a-generation)"" of leadership (born in the 1970s or slightly after).

However Xi will likely remain as a CCP elder with meaningful influence on the overall direction of the country and party but I expect the active leadership to be from someone from the 7th generation. (The 6th generation of leadership will probably not see a paramount leader from their cohort -- there will be no successor for 2022.)

This is my own personal projection and observation; I certainly don't claim it to be guaranteed but I think it is one of the more likely paths forward assuming that Xi's elevation of power is not merely something done to attain ""power for the sake of power""."

Right now the Ukrainians have taken back their earlier statement about ruling out «terror» as the reason for the crash. 
At the same time the Iranians refuse to hand over the black-box to Ukrainian or international autorities. 
According to german media the plane just dissapeared at 8000ft without any kind of sos-signal being sent, very weird especially considering that the 737 non-MAX is THE safest plane in international traffick. 
Within minutes of the crash Iranian media and spokesmen claimed the plane had sufferes from engine failure, with no evidence what so ever to back it up. 
If you look at the pictures from the crash there is literally nothing left resembeling a plane at some point. 

So what if the only failure tonight was in the Iranian AA defences or it was a deliberate move even? The retaliation we have seen so far is mostly symbolic as there have been no casualties ay all. 
What could we expect to happen if it turns out that there were indeed no miltary, but a 180 civilian casualties tonight?

China loses key battle in its aim to control UN intellectual property agency,833,0.94,fgfcf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/fgfcf0/china_loses_key_battle_in_its_aim_to_control_un/,84,2020-3-10,"Last week, Singaporean Daren Tang, head of the Intellectual Property Office Singapore (IPOS), [was selected by the UN World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO) coordination committee](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sporean-poised-to-lead-un-patent-body) to become the next director-general, the first time a Singaporean has been selected for the agency's top spot.

The selection came after a heated battle which pitted those who wanted to see the UN agency pursue its agenda of promoting creative intellectual activity and securing the rights of those engaged in it, namely the US, against those who wanted to see the current deputy director, Wang Binying selected for the role, namely China.

Many experts, not just in the US, worry that as China is able to get leadership spots in the UN specialized agencies, they are able to steer these organizations in a direction that is friendlier to Chinese interests, such as [redefining language concerning civil rights that ""privileges state-led development over fundamental individual rights, and weakens the latter in international law,""](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2020/03/09/commentary/world-commentary/china-loses-skirmish-fight-global-influence/)  inserting Chinese ideological terms and foreign policy strategies such as the Belt and Road initiative into consensus global goals, and of course through denying access and the very existence of Tibetans, Uyghurs, Hong Kong and Taiwan in these organizations. Comments like that of Wu Hongbo, former undersecretary general for the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs, who said that ""as a \[Chinese\] international civil servant, when it comes to Chinese national sovereignty and security, we will undoubtedly defend our country’s interests,"" exacerbate those concerns.

China's commitment to intellectual property rights, as they are seen in much of the world leads to some concern as well. In 2019, [China ranked 49th globally on the Intellectual Property Rights Index of 129 nations monitored](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3065078/singapore-official-set-win-leadership-un-intellectual-property-agency), up from 52nd in 2018. The US rose two spots to No 12. And Singapore rose one to No 4. The US has accused China and their state-run enterprises of hundred of billions of dollars in theft of IP and the European Union [sued China before the WTO over the ""different set of rules"" China appears to operate under when it comes to IP](https://www.ip-watch.org/2018/06/06/eu-files-wto-case-china-ip-rights-protection/), which run contrary to their WTO obligations. China's biggest tech firm, Huawei, has been accused in a US federal lawsuit of a [decades-long effort to steal intellectual property from six US tech companies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/13/us-charges-chinas-huawei-with-conspiracy-steal-us-trade-secrets-new-indictment/), including by offering Huawei employees bonuses for obtaining confidential information.

Many also argue that China mas made it a priority to rapidly file patents for any possible technology they've acquired, legitimately or otherwise, in a bid that many believe violates the core principles of intellectual property protection. China's intellectual property office received 1.5 million patent applications in 2018, accounting for over 46% of global filings. Many corporations outside of China have watched helplessly as their own ideas have been patented in China by Chinese businesses. A 2017 Harvard study shows that Chinese efforts to flood the office with patent applications serves not to improve the protection of intellectual property rights, but has instead [""led to a decline in average patent quality by multiple measures.""](https://economics.harvard.edu/files/economics/files/long-cheryl_quality_implications_of_patent_promotion_policies_in_china_ec2342_seminar_1-25-17.pdf) Others point out that [the vast majority of China's patent filings are worthless](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-26/china-claims-more-patents-than-any-country-most-are-worthless), and of those that are legitimate, many are in surveillance technologies used to oppress ethnic minorities in China on a massive scale.

Without control of the UN international patent awarding body, and without control of the narrative around international property rights going forward, how will China proceed? If multinational corporations and businesses looking to expand globally come to see China as a dead zone when it comes to intellectual property protection, how will that play out in China's efforts to attract global investment and interest in their markets?"

First is the idea that Russia is a declining power whose aggression towards its neighbors is borne of weakness, not strength. It is a defensive power with great strategic depth, but is riddled with weak demographics, a moribund economy, crippling and systemic corruption, an outdated military, and woeful social indicators from alcoholism to suicide to life expectancy. Its GDP is now 8% of the U.S. and 12% of China's (by far the biggest gap in more than a century). It is falling rapidly in the economic totem pole and peak oil will be its deathknell. See here for a variant strain of this analysis: https://thehill.com/opinion/international/470552-the-analysts-are-wrong-putins-aggression-exposes-russias-decline

Second is the idea that Russia is a rising power whose tactical acumen on the world stage places it firmly in the space of the great powers. It is one of the Top 4 ""pillars"" of the geopolitical structure - along with China, the European Union and the United States, and their ties to the Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America give them a major strategic advantage. Their frozen conflict inroads into Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova,  and their big stick diplomacy against Belarus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, etc. are proof of Russia's growing might. They can outmaneuver both the EU and USA with ease and have manager the enviable feat of subverting Western democracy and institutions at pennies on the dollar. See here for a variant strain of this analysis: https://www.thetrumpet.com/15647-russias-return-to-superpower-status

So which is closer to the truth. Is Russia declining or ascendant?"

What I intend to bring to you today is my own, unprofessional (but hopefully respectful of the rules of reporting information in an unbiased manner that I learned in my own field of study) analysis of the predicament that Poland finds herself in, the dangers ahead and the hopes for the future. Or to put it in more dramatic terms, I'd like to outline for you what geopolitically-minded Poles believe needs to go right for Poland to survive as an independent state and what they fear could go wrong.  

I need to warn you in advance that this is not an academic paper, there won't be citations of scholarly literature after each claim. My ""sources"" are a mixture of lectures from both [Polish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3xu1zimPVw&t=2s) and [foreign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q7AgYqoaNs) observers of the subject, various [think tank events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dckWnhSO-EA) and [reports](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1253.html), [articles from more specialized media](https://www.defence24.com/geopolitics/), as well as my own understanding of situation in a broader historical context, my own attempts to read between the lines of what the relevant world leaders are saying as well my perception of the mood in the country sampled from ""the word on the street"".  
If that seems insufficient to you, please keep in mind that my aim is not to bring you any shocking revelations and trend-setting conclusions. I merely wish to present to you the various ways in which more or less geopolitically-conscious Poles think and talk about the present and future of their country. So without further ado, let's begin:  

**The Stage**  

Poland is in its current shape and geographic location strategically indefensible and its geopolitical position independently untenable. With no significant natural barriers in either direction, in her 1000 years of history, independent Poland has never existed for long with greater powers to both West and East. That said, it's important to state that as tragic as the country's flat and indefensible geography is, the part of the Northern European Plain it's situated on is also the narrowest in the North-South direction and along with Ukraine constitutes a gateway between East and West. When Poland controlled most of those lands, her curse was also her blessing and contributed in a major way to Commonwealth's status as a great power. Poland lacking control of the entireity of this gate reaps none of the benefits of having a say who comes through and faces all of the threat of being in the way.  
Poland's current sovereignty can be attributed almost entirely to a ""freeze"" in great power politics brought on by the establishment of the so called ""Rules-Based Global Order"" introduced by the United States following World War 2 in order to bring the Western states together to help America stand against the Soviets.  
After the collapse of the USSR, a decision was made to maintain said order and invite Poland, along with other countries liberated from the Communists who were ready to take that offer, to the club, resulting in Poland joining NATO in 1997 and the EU in 2004. This, along with drastic and arguably haphazard, but comprehensive liberalization reforms carried out in the early 90s, resulted in steady growth of prosperity, culminating in Poland officially joining the ranks of developed countries in 2018.  

**The Predicament**  

Given Poland's unfortunate geography and relatively small population and economy, it can never realistically hope to stand against hostile foreign incursions of both hard and soft power without outside help. That makes it so that what Poland needs above all is a powerful and reliable ally with a vested interest in Poland existing as an independent state. This notion is as obvious today as it was in the inter-war period, but just as back then the allies proved not rich enough in the above qualities to keep Poland from Stalin, the fear is that should the Global Rules-Based Order unravel further, the same will prove to be true once again.  
Of course, great many people in Poland are free from that fear, trusting in lasting endurance of NATO as deterrence to outside threats and the EU continuing to be a stable environment for Poland to thrive in and increase her prosperity and it's entirely possible that they may prove to be correct, but we're not here to look at the world from a perspective in which geopolitical realities are assumed to be put on hold indefinitely.  

**The Dangers**  

The more things change the more they stay the same, the mortal threats to Polish sovereignty remain Russia and Germany. I'll start with Germany as that's the part that already raised more eyebrows and objections and I need to quickly clarify that educated, reasonable Poles on the most part don't consider Germany to be hostile to Poland or believe that it will turn hostile in the future. The threat I am talking about pertains to the sovereignty of Poland, not to Polish lives and basic individual freedoms and the loss of said sovereignty is to happen through further gradual osmosis of German soft power into its weaker neighbour, accelerated by further institutional integration within the EU (especially if conditions of this integration would be unfavourable to Poland), not armed conflict of any kind.  
A large segment of Polish society, what could be roughly described as ""liberals"", considers that outcome to be acceptable if not desirable. Some believe that by the time it happens, we will all be a one big European family and it won't matter who's stronger than who, some concede that it's the only option and it will happen no matter what, so there's no point fighting it and some even believe that being de facto governed by German politicians is prefereable to living under a Polish government. The ""conservatives"" largely see the threat of German domination as one of the main arguments against further European integration, but it's important to note that Poland still remains the most pro-EU country in Europe. I'll come back to that topic later.  

Now let's discuss Russia. Poles view Russia most unfavourably out of any nation in the world and there is virtually no diplomatic dialogue between the two countries. When you say ""foreign threat"" in Poland, you're saying ""Russia"", when Polish army trains, it trains against Russia, when Polish MOD buys equipment, people will judge the purchase based on how they think it will fare against what the Russians have. Polish politicians have to bite their tongue not to call Russia ""enemy"" when speaking publicly and the guy who tried to start a pro-Russian political party ended up locked in jail, because he was found out to be an agent.  
The reason for that is that everyone barring a handful of fringe political groups, especially from the extreme right, recognizes that Polish and Russian interest in the region are fundamentally irreconcilable, the same as they ever were.  
Other than the need for good allies, what is also universally recognized in Poland is that the country would greatly benefit economically and strategically from being neighboured by friendly, like-minded countries to the East. **Continued independence of the Baltics as well as integration of Ukraine and hopefully Belarus into the political and economic sphere where Poland resides are vital geopolitical interests of Poland.** Securing these latter two goals would push the Russian threat further away (I don't want to use the term ""buffer zone"", since that term has very negative connotations when applied to this part of the world due to what Russians understand by it), make Poland less periferial in this community of nations and preferably allow it to extert the same kind of influence that Germany exterts on Poland.  
Russia has obviously other plans for the region and I have to leave it at that, because explaining the point of view of Russia is a monumental task that goes far beyond the scope of this post.  
Now an important question is what geopolitically-literate persons in Poland exactly fear from Russia. Few consider an outright invasion of Poland to be a real possibility in circumstances remotely resembling the ones we have today, although it's important to note that according to most analysts and recently conducted war games, from a purely-strategic point of view and based on concentration of troops in the region, Russia is perfectly capable of swiftly beating Polish forces and forcing them to retreat beyond Vistula assuming access through Belarus.  
A more realistic scenario is a Russian incursion into one of the aforementioned countries of interest forcing Poland to either react and risk potentially even nuclear retaliation or concede to being encroached on by a threat that could one day turn existential.  
A specific and the most relevant example of such a scenario is a Russian incursion into one of the Baltic states. Assuming Belarussian neutrality (which is the better option for Poland), the aid provided to the Baltics would need to come through the Suwałki gap (the strip of land where Poland borders Lithuania) which is not possible due to the concentration of the area-denial missile systems in the exclave of Kaliningrad. To open the passage, those area-denial system must first be destroyed. So **in order to protect her vital geostrategic interests, Poland would need to get a go-ahead from her more powerful Western allies (i.e. United States) to attack Russian territory, destroy crucial Russian assets and risk starting a nuclear war.** Or go at it alone and get smacked down by Russia eventually. Nobody assumes that Poland has the green light to provoke a nuclear war, so that's a serious headache. And it gets worse.  

**The Future**  
*or riding two horses into the storm*   

As bad as being expected by your stronger allies to be the first to confront a greater threat without knowing how much political will to support you if you do there is, it gets worse without them. With increasing talks of a) EU wishing to become independent from US militarily b) American leadership reconsidering its commitments to Europe and shifting its attention towards Asia and (I don't want to make this political in the internal sense, but it would be dishonest not to mention it) c) Polish government's universally condemned transgressions against the system of democratic checks and balances weakening Poland's claim of entitlement to protection by the Rules-Based Order by default, Poland might soon face a situation where failing to secure firm commitment from one of her allies will leave her with none. Which one of those allies should Poland stake her chips on is the essence of the geopolitical debate in Poland and that's regardless of whether the participants realize that what they're talking about is geopolitics or not. If you exclude the fringe, and in my personal view, ignorant propositions that Poland should either stand alone against the world or cozy up to Russia (A sidenote: there is an intriguing notion that Russia might be willing to extend a very sweet deal to Poland to secure our non-interference in the next Russian adventure, but if such a thing was to happen, it would be because Poland is a problem for Russia, not because they like us, so that's not an argument for being pro-Russian before that happens), what we're left with are two directions, doctrines or options:  

**The Atlantic Option**  

Proponents of the Atlantic Option will tell you that Poland is a prime candidate to serve as a continental anchor for the atlantic sea powers of United Kingdom and United States and it's reasonable to expect those countries to be interested in keeping us an ally. The idea is that Americans and the British have a use for Poland as a form of a wedge between Germany and Russia keeping those countries from consolidating into something that could threaten them.  
Its opponents will tell you that Poland is on the wrong side of the Jutland peninsula to be the continental anchor and that turning our back on EU and clinging onto Americans for dear life like we currently do without even knowing if they will care about what happens in Europe is misguided. Whether the latter will prove to be true or not, the apparent pros of this option are enticing. For one, US being the (increasingly doubted, but still reigning) military hegemon and being too far to extert the kind of dominating influence a neighbour could, is the perfect ally for Poland assuming their commitment. And Americans, whether they mean it or not, assure us of their commitment at every occasion, so for as many things as you can fault our government, not being eager to mistrust them is not one of them. Secondly, to serve as this wedge, Poland would need to be in a decent shape not only militarily, but also economically and being economically propped-up by the largest economy on the planet (in nominal GDP, I know) is again a mouth-watering perspective. Finally a firm alliance with America would likely imply encouragement and support for Poland to extend its influence to the the countries of interests I mentioned earlier in order to incorporate them into the wedge, whereas European states could just easily have them for themselves.  
As for the cons, other than the lack of certainty of reciprocity, they are as follows:  
- being America's great landing strip would put us in greater danger than a humble existence within EU would  
- many people strongly favour European values and the institutions that foster them over American flavour of freedom with its for-profit prisons and things of this sort  
- turning our back completely on EU if we were ever forced to could be economically suicidal to the point where even the mighty US couldn't subsidize us out of poverty given how deeply Polish economy is integrated with the EU, especially Germany  

For now, despite the threat of United States turning its attention entirely to Asia (or even, God forbid, sacrificing us to Russia for their aid there), electing an islolationist president or an idealist president who deems alliance with Poland not worth tolerating our leaders' encroachment on democratic values, or even the possibility that when things get too tense, the Americans will reveal that they never cared that much to begin with, we put our faith in the Atlantic Option. That's a long list of cons and despites, which is understandable why many people prefer

**The Continental Option**  

The Continental Option stakes Poland's security on firm integration with the EU. Its proponents believe that just as good EU was for us economically as an economic union, it will be good for us militarily as a military union. They reasonably posit that Poland, being a country with a major interest in security matters, should jump at Macron's invitation to form a EU army and place their allegiance there instead of USA in matters like military equipment procurement and the choice of foreign expeditions, eventually even aiding in going against the interests of the United States should that ever happen to be good for Europe. They believe that a deeply united Europe would be a formidable force that nobody would dare confront and that a membership in this organization is more than enough to keep Poland safe. The problems with this approach vary from obvious, like the fact that no European country has currently any real capability to project significant force into Poland or the fact that major European powers don't share the same attitude to Russia as we do (see: Nord Stream 2), to very controversial like potentially questionable long term viability and stability of the union itself. The last problem, which I hinted at before, is the notion that even if things go splendidly in terms of ensuring Poland's security, integrating our armed forced into a structure that's in large part controlled by states which may not have our best interests in mind in matters less drastic than foreign incursions will result in finalizing the de facto loss of sovereignty that a deep integration into the EU entails. As many potential flaws as there are with this deal, it seems to be the one that is more likely to remain on the table should our worries about the direction the world is going were to materialize.  

**Conclusion**

As you can see, given that both options are, however much needed, far from perfect and in a nightmare scenario it's possible that neither will be avaliable or sufficiently realized when needed, if Poland is ever forced to choose (and we're not here to proclaim The End of History and state that it never will), it's reasonable to expect that things will never be as good as they are now that we have the luxury of enjoying all the military and economic boons that a one, amicable community of nations has to offer us.  
It's important to note that both sides of the debate have arguments with merit and it's near-impossible to objectively attribute the correct amount of weight to them without countless preconceptions and biases getting in the way. **It's a difficult and important debate and its outcome could determine not only the fate of countries that along with Poland would need to radically reconsider how they see their security situation, but even significantly influence the nature of the future relationship between United States and European Union.**

Introduction to Lobster Politics,723,0.99,db39es,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/db39es/introduction_to_lobster_politics/,48,2019-9-30,"*[See part 2 here](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/dvj44y/lobster_politics_part_2/)*

##The nature of lobsters

**Lobsters** are [decapod crustaceans](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/15/2464), 'ten-footed' marine animals, a classification which includes clawed lobsters, spiny lobsters, crabs, shrimps, and crayfish. The precise nature of lobsters, specifically whether they are fish, has been a contested issue in international law for more than one hundred years. There are [30 species](http://www.mesa.edu.au/crustaceans/crustaceans05b.asp) of clawed lobsters, but the most important is the *Homarus americanus* or American lobster, which is found in the Atlantic. More than half of all lobster products are produced in Canada and the United States while the top three lobster-importing countries are Japan, China, and the U.S. There are 45 species of *Panulirus spp.* or spiny lobsters and *Jasus spp.* or [rock lobsters](https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/200/m200p241.pdf), which are found near the coasts of Florida, Brazil, Cuba, and Australia, and are grouped together. Australia and New Zealand are the biggest producers of spiny lobster products. *Homarus gammarus*, the [European lobster](https://www.imr.no/genimpact/filarkiv/2007/07/european_lobster.pdf/en), can be found from the Norwegian Sea to the Aegean Sea. Lobsters are not stationary: they migrate an average of 30 kilometres (19 miles) a year, though some migrate more than [900 miles](https://mlcalliance.org/all-about-lobster/lobster-101-habitat/), making lobster management and ownership difficult and contentious. Lobsters have existed for at least [120 million years](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-lobster/mexico-finds-worlds-oldest-lobster-fossil-idUSN0242811320070503) and live as long as [140](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/4213315/George-the-140-year-old-lobster-to-be-released-by-New-York-restaurant.html) years, showing little cell degradation as they age. They are also capable of [reflex amputation](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/outreach-and-education/fun-facts-about-luscious-lobsters), regrowing lost limbs.

##Why lobsters are so valuable

The [global lobster market](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4775667/lobster-market-global-industry-trends-share?utm_source=BW&utm_medium=PressRelease&utm_code=xs7x4l&utm_campaign=1271187+-+Global+Lobster+Market+Overview+%26+Outlook+2019-2024+-+Leading+Players+are+East+Cost+Seafood%2c+Garbo+Lobster%2c+High+Liner+Foods%2c+Escanaba%2c+and+Thai+Union&utm_exec=joca220prd) is worth €6.7 billion/$5.7 billion USD (2018). Market researchers project the lobster trade will reach €12.51 billion/$13.9 billion USD in value in 2024. The current value of lobsters is based almost solely as seafood, but that may change. There are [more than 200](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/) known applications for lobsters and lobster by-products. Chitin, a biopolymer derived from lobster shells, can be extracted easily and cheaply by grinding up the shells, which traditionally have been trashed. Adding sodium hydroxide to chitin produces [chitosan](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/af57/fa5a2b237174301b9b2740adbbe531a4a527.pdf), a carbohydrate with biomedical applications. The U.S. Army has used more than 400,000 [field bandages](https://www.wired.com/2007/02/shrimp-bandages-save-soldiers/) from shrimp chitosan and now a company has created [lobster-based](https://www.timesrecord.com/articles/front-page/maine-firm-creating-bandages-made-with-lobster-shells/) chitosan bandages. MIT and Harvard University researchers are turning lobster chitin into a flexible, more maneuverable, [body armor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/19/mit-scientists-are-using-lobsters-develop-new-form-flexible-body-armor/). Researchers at [McGill University](https://www.ellsworthamerican.com/maine-news/waterfront/scientists-find-better-way-to-make-use-of-lobster-shells/), the Royal College of Art, and Imperial College London have made lobster chitin into a recyclable, biodegradable [alternative](https://www.businessinsider.com/lobster-shells-plastic-biodegradable-recycle-single-use-waste-2019-5) to single use plastic products like straws and plastic bags. Researchers at the University of Havana have developed [surgical threads](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070713131300.htm) and stitches from lobsters. Lobster chitin can also act as a [surgical implant](https://www.pressherald.com/2018/12/08/researchers-find-new-way-to-convert-lobster-shells-into-durable-plastic/). [Lobster blood](https://bangordailynews.com/2017/01/20/business/lobster-blood-could-be-the-next-best-thing-to-help-treat-warts-shingles/) treats warts and shingles and other skin issues. [Chitin](https://www.joc.com/crabs-lobsters-claw-their-way-uses-medicine-and-food_19880608.html) is a food preservative. It treats itching from burn wounds. It is used in [nutraceuticals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4336979/), nutritional, medicinal products, and [pharmaceuticals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/), medicinal drugs. Chitin acts as chickenfeed and can be made into [dog biscuits](https://archive.bangordailynews.com/2006/03/09/making-it-in-maine-lobster-bisque-its-let-canine-companions-enjoy-seafood/) and compost.

Humans have eaten lobsters for thousands of years. Lobsters are typically boiled alive to prevent transmission of Vibrio vulnificus, a bacteria found in lots of seafood, which spreads through lobsters within hours of their deaths. Untreated vibrio infections have a [30-50%](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/seafood-lovers-dangers-vibrio-bacteria/story?id=56688448) mortality rate. Lobsters are also difficult to transport for long periods as they tend to get sick and die or resort to cannibalism in confined spaces. Lobsters are a [high protein, low fat](https://www.seafoodworld.net/nutritional-value-of-lobsters/) food and are arguably superior to red meat. As researchers from the University of Adelaide [explain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/), ""The amino acid profile of crustacean protein such as lobster is comparable to that of red meat protein, but it contains more nonprotein nitrogen (amino acids, small peptides, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), trimethylamine, creatine, creatinine, and nucleotides) ranging from 10–40%. Thus, crustacean protein is more palatable than meat proteins.""

##Lobster conflicts

###China, the U.S., and Canada

####U.S. regulations

American lobstermen have been subjected to tremendous economic pressure, first from government regulation, then hurricanes, competition from Canada, and now the U.S.-China trade war. The North Atlantic right whale, a critically endangered species, tends to get tangled in the ropes lobstermen use in their lobster traps. The population has been in a decade-long decline, mostly dying after getting tangled or struck by boats. In [2009](https://bangordailynews.com/2009/11/15/news/lobster-fishermen-shed-floating-rope/), the U.S. government forced lobstermen to switch from floating rope to sinking rope, and 1.6 million pounds of rope had to be discarded and replaced. In 2015, the government limited trap lines and lobstermen switched to stronger lines, which [actually killed more whales](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/protected/whaletrp/trt/meetings/September%202018/tm247__2_.pdf). The federal government is [now](https://www.wsj.com/articles/noaas-plan-to-save-the-whales-has-maine-lobstermen-boiling-11567809249) pressuring the industry to come up with more regulations to address the issue. In 2018 and again in [2019](https://www.mainepublic.org/post/maines-lobster-industry-braces-catastrophic-cuts-bait-fish-catch), the U.S. government imposed stringent herring quotas. Lobstermen, who relied on herring as lobster bait, [switched](https://www.wbur.org/earthwhile/2019/05/28/lobster-bait-herring-shortage-fisheries) to pig hides and other species of fish from outside local areas. American lobstermen are regulated at five levels of government: local, state, federal, international, and by the [Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission](http://www.asmfc.org/about-us/program-overview), an inter-state compact created by the federal government in 1942. Competitors outside the U.S. face less regulation and lax enforcement of existing rules.

####Canadian competition

Canada has [only recently](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/canada-boosts-protection-of-north-atlantic-right-whales) moved to protect the whales and has far fewer restrictions on lobster fishing. For example, Canadian lobstermen do not have a lobster maximum [size limit](https://www.savingseafood.org/news/washington/sen-susan-collins-questions-lobster-tariffs-and-grey-zone-dispute/) while American lobstermen are [limited](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/species/lobster/guide/index.html) to catching lobster's with a body shell length of five inches. The bigger the lobster shell, the more meat it has and the greater the lobster's value. In [September 2017](https://bangordailynews.com/2019/08/26/news/hancock/its-lost-much-of-its-overseas-business-but-a-lobster-firm-is-starting-up-in-bucksport/), the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement went into affect, eliminating 98% of EU tariffs on Canadian goods. It allowed Canada to export lobsters to the EU, replacing American lobster exports. That same month Florida lobstermen [lost 100,000 lobster traps](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article228822799.html) to Hurricane Irma.

####U.S.-China trade war

The U.S.-China trade war has turned Maine - and Senator Susan Collins - into a target for retaliatory tariffs. Maine lobster exports to China increased by [169%](https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/maine-delegation-urges-aid-for-members-of-lobster-industry-affected-by-trade-war) from 2017 to 2018. In July 2018, the U.S. government placed a 25% tariff on Chinese goods. China retaliated with a 25% tariff on American goods, including live lobsters. On September 1, 2019, China retaliated again, raising the tariff to 35%. U.S. lobster exports to China have [declined by 80%](https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2019/08/26/how-chinas-tariffs-are-affecting-u-s-lobster-exports) while Canadian lobster exports doubled. The U.S. government instituted a 25% tariff on raw steel imported from Canada and Mexico from 2018-2019. The tariff only covered *raw* steel not finished products made from steel, inadvertently making imported [lobster traps](https://www.kvcrnews.org/post/got-lobster-trumps-steel-tariffs-threaten-trap-industry#stream/0) price competitive with American-welded traps. The U.S. Commerce Department is now weighing whether China and Mexico have [dumped](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-imposes-new-tariff-chinese-mexican-steel) steel, which could result in another round of anti-dumping tariffs.

Some of the shift from 'American' to 'Canadian' lobster exports to China is contrived. Lobsters can grow to up to [four](https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2011/0616/How-large-can-lobsters-grow-Big!-But-no-one-knows-how-big) feet long, but lobster eggs are 1/16"". Lobster smuggling is a multi-million dollar enterprise in southeast Asia. Smugglers are now [trafficking American lobsters](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/supply-trade/us-companies-accused-of-dumping-lobster-in-asia) and [Australian rock lobsters](https://www.scmp.com/article/732369/rock-lobster-row-confirms-hk-asia-smuggling-hub) into China.

####Climate change

Climate change has been great for Maine lobstermen. The Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than 99% of the ocean, resulting in a [515% increase](https://www.gmri.org/news/news-archive/new-study-industry-conservation-ethic-proves-critical-gulf-maine-lobster-fishery) in Maine's lobster population over the last thirty years while other lobster populations elsewhere - like nearby Massachusetts - completely collapsed. However, warming waters also encouraged a growth in the [black sea bass](https://www.mvtimes.com/2019/03/12/black-sea-bass-gobbling-lobsters/) population, which gorge on baby lobsters.

Climate change may make the Maine lobster population [fall as hard](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/1831) over the next thirty years as it rose over the last thirty years as lobsters permanently migrate north, avoiding the uncomfortably hot water in the Gulf of Maine. Our understanding of lobster biology is incomplete. For example, scientists did not know how to precisely determine a lobster's age until 2012, when the University of New Brunswick in Saint John found that [dissecting the eyestalks](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/rings-on-a-lobster-can-tell-its-age-1.1235997) of decapod crustaceans reveals rings that grow once per year. Scientists still debate whether lobsters are capable of feeling pain. We know [American](https://www.boem.gov/espis/5/5659.pdf) and spiny lobsters are magnetoreceptive and that magnetic fields play a role in determining lobster migration (like birds), but we do not know *[why](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Lohmann/publication/299648639_Effect_of_magnetic_pulses_on_Caribbean_spiny_lobsters_Implications_for_magnetoreception/links/5762b58608ae17328926f4ad/Effect-of-magnetic-pulses-on-Caribbean-spiny-lobsters-Implications-for-magnetoreception.pdf?origin=publication_detail)* they are magnetoreceptive or how this influences their movements. Studies have repeatedly found that electromagnetic fields generated by [undersea power cables](https://www.boem.gov/Environmental-Stewardship/Environmental-Studies/Pacific-Region/Studies/2011-09-EMF-Effects.aspx) [influence](https://www.ecori.org/narragansett-bay/2019/9/11/sharks-lobsters-impacted-by-electric-cables-from-offshore-wind) lobster migration.

####Temperature

In the 1920s, studies concluded the ideal temperature for lobster breeding is 15 °C (59 °F) or higher (Huntsman, 1923, 1924). From the 1960s to the 1980s, the scientific consensus placed ideal temperatures at a mean annual sea temperature of 8 to 11 °C (48 to 52 °F) (Dow, 1969: 1062-1063). Today, the scientific consensus is that lobsters cannot handle temperatures above [20°C](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-and/climate-lobsters) (68°F). A [2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783616303150) study found that lobster larvae are negatively affected at 20-24 °C (68-75 °F), but die off at 24-36 °C (75-97 °F), and recommended further examination of the effect of temperature on lobster survival. In 1999, scientists first [identified](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/23/nyregion/deaths-of-lobsters-in-long-island-sound-tied-to-tiny-parasite.html) a parasite, paramoebiasis, which seemed to kill lobsters weakened by high temperatures during a mass die-off. Paramoebiasis passes between infected and healthy lobsters within weeks of cohabitation. There is no guarantee that water temperatures will continue to rise in the Gulf of Maine as we may be at or near the crest of the [Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-and/climate-lobsters). The [American Lobster Settlement Index](https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2019/05/31/from-coast-to-coast-companies-team-up-to-fund-umaine-lobster-research/), first established in 1989, began surveying deep water lobster populations in 2016. ALSI is exploring the theory that lobsters are moving east into deeper (colder) water.

####Mortality

Lobster catches and landings have always fluctuated over multi-year periods with several past scares of unexplained mass die-offs, leading to premature fears of lobster extinction. The average female lobster has 10,000 eggs and females can have up to [100,000](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/faq/faq-archive/fishfaq7.html) eggs, but the survival rate for baby lobsters in the wild is one tenth of one percent. In 2012, Norwegian aquarists [doubled](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/12/121204081144.htm) the survival rate by altering lobster feed in a controlled setting. Experimental aquarists lowered Caribbean spiny lobster mortality in captivity to 3-70% through repeated experimentation, altering lobster feed and sterilizing seawater. The [National Lobster Hatchery](https://www.nationallobsterhatchery.co.uk/) in Cornwall, England has raised and released more than [100,000](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-27499270) healthy lobsters in captivity. This suggests that aquaculture may mitigate the historically high mortality rate in lobster larvae.

####Machias Seal Island

The U.S. and Canada both [claim](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2018/07/22/machias-seal-island-dispute) ownership of Machias Seal Island, a dispute that revolves around a 400-year old legal question. Canada argues that a 1621 land grant made Machias Seal Island part of Nova Scotia and that the 1783 Treaty of Paris exempted Nova Scotian islands from the islands Canada agreed belonged to the United States. The U.S. argues the grant did not make the island part of Nova Scotia and thus the Treaty of Paris recognized American sovereignty over the island. Canada controls the island itself and has had a lighthouse there since 1832. In [1984](https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/67), the International Court of Justice delimited boundaries for the U.S. and Canada, but did not consider the issue of Machias Seal Island. In 2002, Canada legalized lobster fishing in the Grey Zone, the waters around the island where American lobstermen had previously enjoyed exclusive access. Enhanced immigration enforcement in the Trump administration has seen U.S. Border Patrol authorities detain Canadians in the Grey Zone while American lobstermen have begun [arming](https://www.wgbh.org/news/arts/2019/01/29/theres-a-quiet-war-over-lobsters-near-the-canadian-border) themselves, threatening Canadian lobstermen, and there has been mutual lobster trap sabotage. In 2009, disputes between the residents of Matinicus Island, an American island slightly west of Machias Seal Island, and the mainland U.S. also led to [armed confrontations](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32054066/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/police-maine-lobster-turf-war-led-shooting/#.XYPyDCV7l0s), and in 1998, Monhegan Island residents successfully lobbied for exclusive rights to lobstering near their island.

###Miskito, Nicaragua, and Honduras

The Miskito are a pre-Columbian, largely [Moravian](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009182968701500204?legid=spmis%3B15%2F2%2F49&patientinform-links=yes) Protestant people of 300,000. Their native land occupies eastern Honduras and Nicaragua. While Nicaragua and Honduras have a small share of the international lobster market, the lobster industry generates €133 million/$100 million USD (2014) in revenue. They export most of their catch to the United States, particularly the Florida-based restaurant chain [Red Lobster](http://www.ipsnews.net/2004/02/honduras-death-looms-over-miskito-lobster-divers/). The Miskito [overwhelmingly](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1525/cag.1999.21.3.10) make up Nicaragua's lobster divers, but do not own the actual lobster boats, earning only a pittance for their lobster catch. While North American lobstermen trap their lobsters, most Miskito lobstermen dive, a practice that is illegal in most countries because of the danger to divers who decompress too quickly. While North American lobsters are shipped alive, Miskito lobstermen sell frozen lobsters, a far less valuable product. While some American lobstermen [earn six figure salaries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oceans-tide-lobster-specialreport/ocean-shock-lobsters-great-migration-sets-up-boom-and-bust-idUSKCN1N420I), the poverty and desperation of Miskito lobstermen have led them to dive farther out to sea at greater depths and out of season, taking younger, smaller catch, inflicting permanent ecological damage to the lobster population and physical damage to themselves.

####Historical background

The Miskito nation became a British protectorate in 1638, an alliance that endured until 1860, when the British transferred sovereignty of the Miskito kingdom to Nicaragua (through the Treaty of Managua) while maintaining its self-governing autonomy. In 1894, the Nicaraguans annexed the Miskito's territory, violating the Treaty of Managua and triggering a brief British occupation. In the 1970s, the Miskito, Sumo, and Rama nations pressed Nicaragua's Somoza regime for land concessions and legally recognized self-rule, which they had had from 1860 to 1894. Somoza never gave in to their requests. In 1979, the Sandinista revolutionaries (FSLN) took control of Nicaragua and nationalized the seafood industry. Representatives of the three pre-Columbian nations presented Plan 81, defining formal borders for their lands. Instead of land reform and economic assistance, the Sandinistas [burned down and bombed](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/29/movies/on-13-sandinistas-vs-miskitos.html) Miskito villages, forcibly relocating the population they had economically disenfranchized. In 1985, the U.S. cut off all trade with Nicaragua, an embargo that lasted for four years. Nicaragua bypassed the order by presenting [millions of pounds of lobsters](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/19/world/us-gets-taste-of-managua-embargo.html) caught in Nicaragua as 'Honduran lobsters'. Japanese and Honduran lobstermen purchased lobster licenses, working in what Miskito considered their territory without their permission while the government [banned](https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/1206/120652.html) lobster diving, which effectively shut out the Miskito from the industry because Miskito fishermen did not own lobster boats. In 1985, the American Indian Movement, which had been part of the international indigenous rights movement since the 1970s, threatened to [invade](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/11/world/us-indians-enlist-in-the-miskito-cause.html) Nicaragua. In 1988, they were finally granted autonomy (effective in 1990), and in 1990, the lobster ban was lifted.

In 2002 and 2006, the right-wing government of Enrique Bolaños provoked threats of secession from the Miskito (in Nicaragua and Honduras) when he pushed for a transnational dry canal. The canal was never built, but in 2009, the Miskito, partly motivated by [declining lobster profits](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/world/americas/10nicaragua.html), declared independence and have since been in a decade-long low level war with the Nicaraguan government with accusations of violent attacks (including beheadings), land seizures, arson, kidnapping, and rape. In 2013, President Ortega, hated by the Miskito for the original lobster ban, granted a concession to a Hong Kong-based company to build a full, transnational canal through Miskito territory. The Miskito conflict is largely confined to Nicaragua as Honduras now [recognizes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/09/12/honduras-miskito-indians-title-coastal-lands/2807695/) Miskito sovereignty over a territory of 1.86 million acres (920,000 hectares), the land the Miskito had been guaranteed control over in 1860.

####Lobsters and Cocaine

Cocaine traffickers have filled the void left by the Honduran government's withdrawal from Miskito lands. Honduras and Nicaragua do not have the mountains necessary to grow coca, but their location in between cocaine producing countries like Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, and cocaine consuming countries, namely the U.S., has made the ungoverned Miskito space a natural transshipment point for Colombian and Mexican drug cartels since about 2007. Some Miskito lobstermen, unable to make a steady living fishing, have collaborated with traffickers. USAID recognized the lobster-cocaine link and since 2008 has spent [almost a million dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/world/americas/in-remote-honduras-area-drug-raid-stirs-anger.html) to beef up the lobster industry as part of its counter-narcotics strategy. Traffickers travel using planes and boats from Colombia to Bluefields, the capital of Nicaragua's Miskito territory. If traffickers think they have been spotted and risk arrest, they will dump their contraband into the ocean. The cocaine that is dumped and washes ashore is known as '[white lobster](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Nicaraguan-town-rides-high-on-cast-off-cocaine-3168753.php)'. Finding and selling dumped cocaine has become its own profession as the average cocaine package is worth more than €91,000/$100,000 USD in a region with per capita incomes below €5,400/$6,000 USD. Some Miskito nationalists in Nicaragua have [openly suggested](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-13210289) collaborating with drug cartels and accepting that the Miskito economy is now a narco-economy.

###Canada, France, and the UK

The Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 ended the War of Spanish Succession. It also recognized France's right to fish off the northern coast of Newfoundland, fishing rights that had survived the Seven Years War. In the late nineteenth century, Canadian lobstermen moved into French territory, setting up lobster processing factories and violating what the French saw as their exclusive right to fish off the coast. The French lodged official protests, worried about the impact of lobster traps on caplin, which the French used as fishing bait, and cod, which ate lobsters, the potential extinction of the local lobster population, and the seeming disinterest of the British Colonial Office in resolving the issue. The British argued that French fishing rights were concurrent with Canadian fishing rights, that the right to fish did not extend to lobsters because they are crustaceans not fish, and that France needed to negotiate with the Canadians. At the time however, many in England used the word *fish* to mean any animal that lives in the ocean. In 1886, a French warship destroyed a Canadian lobster factory at Port Saunders, and another lobster factory nearby in 1889. The Newfoundlanders responded with the Bait Acts, a series of laws that cut off French access to Canadian bait. The French and British maintained the dispute from 1881 until they reached a compromise, modifying French rights when they signed the Anglo-French Convention in 1904.

###Japan and the U.S.

In 1964, the [Continental Shelf Convention](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXI-4&chapter=21&clang=_en) (CSC), an international treaty, recognized the exclusive right of nations to the territorial waters, sea beds, and natural resources therein that extends [200 nautical miles](https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/continental_shelf_description.htm) from a nation's continental shelf, known as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The CSC includes *[sedentary species](https://www.oceansatlas.org/subtopic/en/c/20/)* in its definition of natural resources exclusively owned by adjacent coastal states. Fish are not included in this definition because they freely pass in and out of an EEZ. Lobsters (and crabs) defy easy categorization because while they are not embedded in sea soil like oysters or clams, they also do not swim through the ocean, they walk on the seafloor. Japanese fishermen had fished for crabs and lobsters in Alaska's continental shelf near the Aleutian Islands, so in 1964, the Japanese argued neither qualified as sedentary species. While the U.S. refrained from formally accepting that either are sedentary species, they compromised, allowing the Japanese to continue fishing in the continental shelf with annual quotas.

###France and Brazil

In the 1960s, France and Brazil had a bloodless military confrontation known as the Lobster War over whether French fishermen had the right to fish for lobsters in Brazil's continental shelf. Mauritania gained its independence from France in 1960. French lobstermen worried they would lose access to Mauritanian fisheries, which had been in a twenty year decline, and began looking elsewhere for lobsters. In 1961, four French ships crossed the Atlantic to Brazil, catching 85,000 lobsters in one month. Brazil initially granted three ships the right to fish off their coast, but dozens of ships followed, so Brazil banned foreign lobster fishing altogether. Fishermen ignored the ban, and in 1962, a massive haul of lobster prompted the Brazilian navy to start boarding French boats. The Brazilian government argued that lobsters traverse the sea floor and therefore were part of the continental shelf, which Brazil exclusively held sway over. France argued lobsters swim like fish and are therefore not part of the continental shelf. The Brazilians [suggested](https://www.vice.com/fr/article/qvg3vp/quand-le-bresil-et-la-france-declenchaient-une-guerre-pour-quelques-langoustes) that if lobsters are fish because they live in water, then kangaroos are birds because they jump in the air.

On January 30, 1963, the Brazilian government boarded and seized three French fishing boats. The French navy sent warships, including a destroyer and an aircraft carrier, to Brazil, and Brazil deployed its navy. France took the issue to the International Court of Justice, but before a decision could be rendered, in 1964, the Brazilian military overthrew President Goulart in a coup d'état. His successor, Castelo Branco, signed a deal accommodating French interests in December 1964, allowing some French lobstermen to fish for five years. In 1966, Brazil took another group of French fishermen when they illegally fished off Fortaleza. In 1969, the Brazilians expanded their designated territorial seas to 12 miles out, and in 1970, they expanded it to 200 miles from their coast.

Refuting a common misconception - Is Saudi Arabia trying to 'drive out' North American shale?,703,0.99,3wrnqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/3wrnqz/refuting_a_common_misconception_is_saudi_arabia/,108,2015-12-14,"So this is a commonly repeated viewpoint, both in this subreddit and in the broader reddit-verse and media.  It goes something like 

>Saudi Arabia is intentionally leaving the oil taps on as a strategy to kill North American shale!  Flood the market with cheap oil, drive out those companies by bankrupting them, then go back to the glorious days of high oil prices!

Sometimes you'll see this repeated with Iran as the primary target, because the Saudis and Iranians have very high tension right now.  Unfortunately, this analysis is mostly false.  It's not 100% wrong - I'm sure the Saudis will be happy if Iran gets hurt, or if North American shale companies go bankrupt.  But it's simply not the primary reason why they are pumping.

---------------------

What is the reason Saudi Arabia is still pumping?  Because they can't drive the price down by themselves - they're only 13% of world oil production.  If they were to cut production, the price of oil would rise...  but not that much. If the price increases by 10-15% but your volume plunges, you just lost a huge amount of money.  It makes zero financial sense to cut production by yourself - you do nothing but lose money.

But what about OPEC?  If OPEC were to slash production as a group, would that make a difference?  Potentially.  OPEC controls about 40% of the world's production.  This is less than their heyday (more than 50%) but it's still a huge chunk.  The problem is that OPEC doesn't work - a cartel only functions if the members trust each other not to cheat.  If a cartel has cheaters who continue to pump high volume after agreeing to a production cut, the cartel falls apart.  And Saudi Arabia absolutely does not trust the rest of OPEC.

To see why, you have to glance backwards a few decades.  In the 1980s the price of oil had slipped heavily, and the Saudis held meetings to push it back up.  The Saudis believed that they had OPEC's agreement to limit production, and started to slash their own production.  The rest of OPEC didn't stick to it, and continued to pump.  The Saudis went forward, undeterred.  The cut their own production to a quarter of previous levels... and not much happened.  The rest of OPEC didn't cut, and prices didn't rise by that much (*certainly* not enough to make up for a 75% fall in volume).  Saudi Arabia lost a boatload of money, and got pissed.  They turned the oil tap back on and flooded the market, and prices dropped like a brick.  That moment essentially sealed the end of OPEC.

Since then OPEC has barely functioned.  Leading up to the 91 Gulf War, Saddam wanted a production cut to help himself and all members.  But the Saudis didn't trust him (or anyone), Iran hated him, and nothing happened.  In the mid-90s oil fell to *fifteen dollars a barrel* before the cartel got its head out of its butt and was able to agree to mild production cuts in 1998.

Even these cuts were unlikely to work for long, or to drive the price of oil very high, but geopolitical factors saved OPEC for a while.  In the early 2000's three things happened

* 9/11
* Two middle eastern wars
* Demand from China and India skyrocketed

Without having to have any production cuts at all, the price of oil went through the roof, shattering OPEC's own lofty late-90s goal for what the price should be.  It was basically nirvana for oil producing countries.  But the deep divisions and mistrust remained.  In 2008 the price began to crash as the global recession hit.  OPEC held meetings and tried to agree to production cuts to keep prices high.  What happened?

>On 10 September 2008, one such production dispute occurred when the Saudis reportedly walked out of OPEC negotiating session where the organization voted to reduce production. Although Saudi Arabian OPEC delegates officially endorsed the new quotas, they stated anonymously that they would not observe them. The New York Times quoted one such anonymous OPEC delegate as saying ""Saudi Arabia will meet the market’s demand. We will see what the market requires and we will not leave a customer without oil. The policy has not changed.""[58]

This is the new reality of OPEC - agreement to cut, followed by backstabbing.  This quote is from 2008, before North American shale was really a huge concern in the market.  But the Saudis see (out of pure, financial self interest) the best thing as 'pump baby pump'.  They don't trust the rest of OPEC - particularly not the basket cases like Venezuela who are almost certain to cheat.  There might be some trust among the Arab gulf states, but not among membership at large - too many poorly run governments and untrustworthy strongmen.  Remember, this is before shale was on anybody's mind as a major problem.

So we reach the current day - prices have dropped because of slowing demand in China, and increased shale production in North America (just to list a few primary reasons).  There are a lot of countries desperate to cut production.  But the Saudis have publicly proclaimed that ""We don't care if prices crash to 20 dollars a barrel"".  That number isn't an accident - *that matches history* - the last time OPEC actually cut was in 1998 when prices hit 15 dollars a barrel.  $15 in 1998 is roughly $21.80 in 2015. Things have to get incredibly, incredibly bad for OPEC to actually band together.  And 20 dollars a barrel is where the Saudis probably stop making money - their production costs are estimated somewhere between 10-20 dollars a barrel ([estimates](http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/24/news/oil-prices-production-costs/) [vary](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/07/22/u-s-winning-oil-war-against-saudi-arabia/)).  The simple truth is that Saudi Arabia can make plenty of money right now because their production costs are so low, and they don't want to lose volume or market share.  They don't trust OPEC to keep with a cut because of their historical experience and the bad governance in many of their partners.  So they keep pumping because there's nothing else to do.

As I stated in the beginning, I'm sure they are happy about some of the side-effects of this strategy.  The Saudis would love to hurt shale producers, even if it would only be a temporary hit to them.  They're definitely happy Iran is feeling the hurt of low oil prices, because Saudi Arabia is basically in a proxy war (or two) with Iran.  The Saudis are also more than happy to hurt Russia, who is financing Assad (whom they oppose).  This is all true, but it's mostly secondary side-effects.  The primary reason for low oil prices today is the 1980's era OPEC cheating - The Saudis have played this game before and gotten burned.  Until things reach their breakeven point of about 15-20 dollars per barrel, Saudi Arabia isn't budging.

As an aside, the entire 'drive shale out of business' model wouldn't really make a lot of sense anyways.  Shale is a flexible (well, flexible for O&G) type of production that can start/stop fairly quickly.  If the price goes back up, shale production revs back up and the price drops again after just a short interlude.  The big American O&G companies are also advancing technology in this area incredibly fast, and the cost to produce is dropping.  Even bankruptcy wouldn't really be a problem - even if all the shale companies went under, the US and Canada are financially advanced.  Some company or financier would always be there to buy up the bankrupted assets and quickly revive the dead company in the event of high prices.

Why was the British Empire so successful?,696,0.92,i8d413,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/i8d413/why_was_the_british_empire_so_successful/,246,2020-8-12,"The British Empire was one of the largest empires that ever existed. British school children could see in their textbooks that one fourth of the globe was colored in red and they must have been proud of it. However, the British empire never had an army as large as France or Germany. It never had a population as large as China or Russia. British technology, although impressive, was not something out of this world. Then why were the British so successful?

After having read a few books about the British Empire (ie. Unfinished Empire, Empire project), it seems to me that the British Empire was more akin to a multinational corporation like Apple of Google. 

For example, Apple provides a useful **platform** for creative and innovative developers and each creator can amass wealth and prestige by developing first class Apps which catch the attention of consumers around the world. In the same vein, the British Empire provided a platform (finance, communication, transport, trade network) for different stakeholders to amass wealth and prestige. 

Chinese merchants in Canton traded with the East India Company and they became rich. Houqwa is the best known example. Some even say that he was one of the richest persons of the early 19th century. Indian merchants, especially the Parsi(Persians), collaborated with the British and they also became rich. Jews from Europe and the Levant, and also from Baghdad joined the Empire and traded with East Asia. The renown Sassoon family is one of them. They were originally from Baghdad but migrated to India and familiarized with the British. The great conglomerate which rules India to this day -  the Tata group -  came also from an illustrious merchant family which did business with the British Empire.

British corporations which dominated China, namely the HSBC, Jardine & Matheson and Swire & Co employed not only white people from Britain but also other Europeans and many Chinese. Actually, those Chinese who worked for them established their own private companies, including banks and factories. They were not traitors to their countrymen, but skilled managers. Even Li Hung Chang, the so called Bismarck of China, hired them to modernize his fatherland. 

Wealthy Germans and French, regardless of any national sentiment of enmity, also invested in Britain and they allocated their wealth in British banks. And unskilled laborers from Malaysia had better chance of earning an income by working for a British company than in other places. 

In other words, Britain provided a ""platform"" for self-enrichment to a myriad of different groups regardless of faith or race. **What came to be the British Empire was in reality a complex network of colluding interests.** 

A passage from *Unfinished Empire* (2012) gives an exquisite illustration of the essence of the British Empire.

>""The island of Singapore... the government, the garrison and the chief merchants are English but the great mass of the population is Chinese, including some of the wealthiest merchants, the agriculturists of the interior, and most of the mechanics and laborers. the native Malays are usually fishermen and boatmen, and they form the main body of the police. The Portuguese of Malacca supply a large number of clerks and smaller merchants. The Klings of Western India are a numerous body of Mohammedans, and, with many Arabs, are petty merchants and shopkeepers. The grooms and washermen are all Bengalese, and there is a small but highly respectable class of Parsee merchants. Besides these there numbers of Javanese sailors and domestic servants, as well as traders from Celebes, Bali, and many other islands of the Archipelago. The harbour is crowded with men-of-war and trading vessels of many European nations, and hundreds of Malay praus and Chinese Junks...little fishing-boats and passenger smapands; and the town comprises handsome public buildings and churches, Mohammedan mosques, Hindoo temples, Chinese joss-houses, good European houses, massive warehouses, queer of old Kling and Chinese bazaars, and long suburbs of Chinese and Malay cottages.""

For the British, the empire is now forever lost, but the lesson still stands. A successful hegemon must provide a *""platform""* which enables the self-enrichment of its partners. In IR parlance, it must provide ""global common goods."" America has been able to provide them for 5 decades after 1945. Would/Can America provide them also in the future? I think this is an important question."

"Hezbollah remains extremely popular among Shia Lebanese and has never had more power in the Lebanese government, however they face three imminent crises with no clear solutions.",677,0.98,f4w6m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/f4w6m0/hezbollah_remains_extremely_popular_among_shia/,34,2020-2-17,"Contrary to some media speculation that support for Hezbollah among Lebanese Shia is waning, a new poll conducted by the [Washington institute](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/new-lebanon-poll-despite-protests-most-shiites-still-back-hezbollah-and-ira) indicates that they remain extremely popular among Lebanese Shia. With a approval rating of 90% with that demographic. In addition with the resignation of Saad Hariri and other member of the ""March 14th Alliance"", for the first time in history the government in unanimously strongly supportive of Hezbollah. However Hezbollah is facing new major challenges politically, financially and diplomatically.

**The first and second crises they face is financial and diplomatic.** Hezbollah three main sources of funding are, contributions by Iran, donations from the Lebanese diaspora, and taxes paid by Shia Lebanese. All three of these sources of revenue are under threat.

Last year six countries declared the entirety of Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Three of the six [Argentina](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-49030561), [Germany](https://apnews.com/45c48fdda55ce0d18d2cc03149e08297) and [The United Kingdom](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47359502), have a large Lebanese Diaspora and are important fundraising centers for Hezbollah. The designation of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization makes sending remittances to them illegal in those three countries, cutting off all legal fundraising Hezbollah can do there. As of yet Brazil and France which host the largest Lebanese diaspora in Europe and South America respectively are yet to follow their neighbors lead on this issue. However for Hezbollah its a dangerous trend that's already limiting their ability to fundraise abroad. 

Their second major source of revenue local taxes and contributions is also under threat. Lebanon has among the highest debt to GDP ratio in the world at 160% of GDP. [According to the BBC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-20/yields-past-100-just-put-lebanon-debt-into-venezuela-territory) the large scale protests followed by the resignation of Prime Minster Saad Hariri has caused international investors to lose faith Lebanese bonds. As of November 20th 2019 debt being sold to Lebanon has a average yearly interest rate of 105%. Up from 13% only 5 weeks previously.

This indicates that investors expect Lebanon to default on its debts within a year. And they have good reason to believe so, in order for the new government to avoid a default and ease the economic crisis they need to appease the protesters, the IMF and Lebanon's historic economic backers.

The Gulf States, the US and the Europeans are the obvious sources of economic aid. However all of them are hostile to Hezbollah, so a government consisting entirely of pro Hezbollah politicians will find it extremely difficult to find major donors. In addition the protests, which have spooked international investors and shut down much of the Lebanese economy  are also strongly opposed to the new government. Lebanon is also in dire need of debt restructuring, however the IMF is highly unlikely to back a government that so many of its major donors are hostile to.

As a result Lebanon defaulting on its debt, followed by a currency and credit crisis isn't a questions of if but when. Saad Hariri and his allies understood this, and decided to concede to protesters demands and step down, as a strategy to direct the anger of the protesters at their political rivals. As well as a way to direct the blame for the inevitable economic crisis at the president Michel Aoun and other pro Hezbollah figures. In short Hezbollah and its allies have risen to supremacy in Lebanon at the worst possible time.

Lastly their final major source of revenue is from donations from Iran. However Trump's ""maxim pressure"" campaign has resulted in the Iranian economy shrinking nearly 10% during the past 2 years. With the  [UN predicting](https://financialtribune.com/articles/domestic-economy/101941/un-forecasts-irans-economy-to-shrink-27-in-2020) their economy will shrink a further 2.7% in 2020. While hard numbers in how much Iran contributes to Hezbollah are hard to come by, Iran's ability to finance them will obviously be limited by serious economic problems at home.

In short Lebanon economic crisis will limit their ability to raise funds at home, while Iran's economic crisis threatens funds from their largest donor. All while the growing trend to label their entire organization a terrorist organization limits their ability to fundraise in Europe and South America.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The third Crisis they face is political.** While they have maintained firm support from their Shia base, their approval rating among Christians in Lebanon has rapidly deteriorated. Over the past decade Hezbollah has been trying to reach out and approve their image among Lebanese Christians with some success. Part of their strategy is their alliance with their former civil war enemy ""Michel Aoun"". This unlikely alliance which allowed Aoun to become president. This and other concessions made to Lebanon's christian parties allowed them to increase their approval rating from 18% among Lebanese Christians in 2010 according to  [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2010/02/04/chapter-1-muslim-views-on-extremist-groups-and-conflict/)  to 45% in 2017 according to the [Washington Insitute](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/new-lebanon-poll-despite-protests-most-shiites-still-back-hezbollah-and-ira).

Their popularity among Lebanese Christians reached its peak in 2018, after Hezbollah agreed to back Aoun's push to expand the powers of the presidency. In Lebanon the president legally has to be a Christian, so expand the powers of the presidency is essentially the same thing as expanding Christian influence in Lebanese politics. As a result their approval rating among Lebanese Christians reached a record high of  [83%](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/new-lebanon-poll-despite-protests-most-shiites-still-back-hezbollah-and-ira)  in 2018.

However the 2019 protest movement has resulted in Hezbollah's approval rating among Christians dropping from 83% to only 33% in a single year. Sines Lebanese Sunnis view Hezbollah in a overwhelmingly negative light and Shia view them in a overwhelmingly positive light, Christians are ultimately the king makers in Lebanese elections. The rapid deterioration of Hezbollah's image among Lebanese Christians does not bode well for Hezbollah's christian allies in future elections.

In addition this is before Lebanon's default. If there is one thing that is a constant across all countries, is that economic downturns reduce the popularity of the sitting government. The opposition understands this, and decided to exit stage left before things get really bad.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In short Hezbollah is facing unprecedented diplomatic, economic and political crises all of which appear to be getting worse not better."

Chile is a sliver of a country that would give Argentina wide access to 2 oceans if claimed. Or since Chile is wealthier --- the reverse is also true.

No one has attempted to integrate any of the weaker, landlocked nations.

To me the whole of South America seems like a kindergarden version of the geopolitical arena. Even during WW1 or 2, America had plans to invade Canada should the need arise.

Is it really a shared language, religion, and culture that prevents them from warring? That certainly hasn't stopped Africa or the Middle East.

Thoughts appreciated on why South America has seemed to eschew state competition so well. My theory is outside pressure from the US has diverted their attention, up until the present when fighting over borders has fallen out of fashion thanks to the development of international norms."
Israel and Hezbollah close to war: An Analysis,632,0.98,cxoa4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/cxoa4u/israel_and_hezbollah_close_to_war_an_analysis/,118,2019-8-31,"Hello! I was debating whether to post this if a conflict breaks out to hedge my bets or do it beforehand, but it seems my impatience won out.

Unless you're Lebanese or Israeli, you're probably not aware that there's a war scare in progress at the moment. In this post, I will try to summarize:

A) The events that have led to the current 'war scare'.

B) Possible 'endings' to these current events.

C) Why I think a limited military skirmish is the most likely 'ending'.
______________________________

#A) What happened?

As I'm sure all of you are aware, Israel has been waging a low intensity air campaign on Iranian assets in Syria (and now Iraq) for years now, with Iran limiting itself to no response or a very symbolic response at best. Why Israel is conducting these strikes and why Iran is not responding to them is outside the scope of this post, but if you can't answer these questions I do advise you read up on the topic before reading on. This is basic background knowledge.

Last weekend (So 5 days ago), Israel kicked this campaign up a notch by crossing two Hezbollah red lines. The first red line involved the IDF bombing a Hezbollah-aligned position (claims differ as to what exactly it was) in Syria and immediately claiming responsibility for it. This strike saw 2 Lebanese members of Hezbollah lose their lives. This crossed a red line established by blood in 2015 (Before continuing, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2015_Mazraat_Amal_incident) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2015_Shebaa_farms_incident) to read up on this incident.), and by a recent speech by Hassan Nasrallah in January of this year. Said line is, ""Any members of the Lebanese Hezbollah killed in Syria by Israeli strikes will be met with a response.""

It doesn't end there however. Hours after said strike, an even more dangerous 'red line' was crossed. This one was established in the wake of the 2006 war, which saw an end to Israeli strikes on Lebanon that were happening on the regular in the years before. (Similar to what we see in Syria now.) Two suicide drones, apparently launched from a small boat in Lebanese territorial waters, exploded in Hezbollah's South Beirut stronghold. Hezbollah claims these drones targeted their media center (which was indeed damaged), but the British Times claims that the drones' actual target was two trucks carrying sensitive equipment related to Hezbollah's precise missile project. Which narrative is true is up to your own personal research, and is not relevant to my point here. 

What matters is that the next day, in an uncharacteristically fiery speech, Hezbollah's leader promised two things: 

1) Hezbollah will respond from ""Lebanon and not from Shebaa"". (The two links I mentioned earlier will give you context as to why that qualifier was added.)

2) Hezbollah will start to down Israeli UAVs selectively. (Something that Hezbollah's leader already hinted they were considering months before this 'triggering' event.)

Since then, Israel has halted patrols on the border, evacuated some posts, and closed off a plethora of roads as they await the Hezb's response. As is usual, media reports make it impossible to guess the scope/extent of the promised response, given every new day brings twenty new contradictory reports as to its seriousness or lack thereof.

One thing is clear however. The Israelis have said in no uncertain terms that if a single IDF soldier is harmed, they will issue a stern military response. This is in contrast to the 2015 incident, that saw Israel take the Hezbollah response to its red-line violation in stride. In other words, the Hezbollah response has a strong chance of triggering an Israeli counter-response. And this is where (the highly simplified) events stand at the moment.

____________________________________________

#What happens next?

These events can play out in many ways from this point, but we can narrow down our list by focusing on two things that **must** happen. 

A) Hezbollah will respond as promised, whether the response ranges from a couple of suicide drones causing only material damage to a bunch of short-range rockets targeting a military post causing loss of human lives, we cannot guess. But there **will** be something.

B) Israel **will** respond to any human casualty. It is an election period, and these statements were issued so clearly that there is little doubt Israel will backtrack on them.

So using these two 'rules', I can think of five possible scenarios, the first three being likely and the second two much less likely.

1) Hezbollah's response is calculated to only cause material damage, Israel's red line is not crossed and the situation is defused. 

2) Hezbollah's response is calculated to only cause material damage, but Israel issues a response nonetheless, seizing on the excuse. 

3) Hezbollah's response causes loss of life, Israel's red line is crossed, and it issues a 'disproportionate' response as promised.

4) Hezbollah does not respond, effectively ensuring that surgical Syria-esque styles will continue in Lebanon and also diminishing the gravitas of Hassan Nasrallah's word. (Maintaining said gravitas is an essential aspect of Hezbollah's hearts and minds strategy, so it is much more of a loss than you'd think.)

5) Hezbollah responds and causes loss of life, but Israel does not make good on its threat making Netanyahu look like a buffoon during an election period.

We will dismiss 4 and 5 as unlikely. That leaves us with 1,2, and 3. The first scenario is basically the status quo, akin to 2015. It is a likely possibility, but I will not explain here why Israel and Hezbollah are not interested in conflict. Usually, being conflict-averse is the norm with these two players, not the exception.

I will, in the next and final section, try to show why options 2 and 3 are very likely possibilities this time, which is why there is a war-scare.

______________________________________________

#Why a Military Skirmish is coming.

In this section, I will focus exclusively on Israel's motivations. This is because all of options 1, 2, and 3 involve Hezbollah responding; and the real question that differentiates the status quo from war is ""Will Israel seize on the opportunity and strike back, or will it take the response like it did in 2015?""

As I'm sure most of you know, Israel has a bone to pick with Hezbollah's nascent 'precision missile' program. In effect, curtailing said program is one of the main reasons of Israel's air campaign in Syria. I've been maintaining for a year now, that if Israel wants to curtail said program in Lebanon militarily this summer is her last potential summer. Why?

A) Next summer is a US election year, and an Israeli war will not look good on Trump.

B) Trump might not get re-elected, and the return of a President that is less friendly with Israel is a distinct possibility.  

C) **Most importantly**, Israel knows that the US pressure campaign on Iran will not last long and they fear a repeat of the JCPOA.

What happened with the JCPOA? Simply, Iran emerged from decades of economic pressure stronger than ever. In other words, the economic stranglehold was easily reversible. No long-term damage was really done to Iran's capabilities, and Israel ever-so-critical of the JCPOA knew that. As Europe persistently tries to rehabilitate Iran, signs are emerging that Israel is very nervous about it.

This week, as Macron brought in Zarif on a surprise visit, Axios contributor Barak Ravid scooped that Netanyahu ""frantically"" scrambled to reach Trump to ask him not to meet Zarif. (Link [here](https://www.axios.com/scoop-netanyahu-tried-to-reach-trump-to-block-zarif-meeting-85a6a92d-51fa-4d55-bb79-e5163b0706ce.html)) And not even 24 hours ago, Netanyahu said as much in a public statement to Macron. (Link [here](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-tells-macron-now-precisely-not-the-time-to-talk-to-iran/)) And while Israel might have dodged the detente bullet now, Trump and Rouhani will happen to be in New York City this September. And even if that turns out in Israel's favor, a major reason the Iranians and Trump aren't talking is because the Iranians aren't caving to Trump's preconditions, not because Trump is not open to talks. In other words, Israel knows that Trump-Iran talks are only a well-placed sentence away. (Ergo, ""Yes, President Trump, we will discuss our missile program."") And then of course, there's the risk that Trump doesn't win re-elections and Israel would be foolish to bet on a more anti-Iran president succeeding Trump.

If decades of global economic pressure unraveled quickly, you'll be surprised how fast this round of pressure will reverse given it has less proponents and has spanned a much smaller duration. In other words, to put it in a sentence, Israel's window to inflict long-term damage on Iran is closing and fast.

To the above, there are two more important facts to add:

1) The US, this week especially, has made numerous expressions of support towards Israel that can easily be read as 'green lights'.

2) Israel willingly crossed two red lines, knowing this would invite a Hezb response. This, more than everything else, is the operant clause here. No politician worth his salt would invite a military response on his own country months away from an election if he didn't plan on emerging a hero from it. 

Before I conclude, I want to pre-emptively answer two criticisms.

Some will say that it is childish of me to assume that Netanyahu would lead Israel to war solely for an election. And that's true. Elections are a factor, but a rapidly closing window (as I've shown) to deal a solid blow to Hezbollah's missile capabilities is the other more important factor.

Another criticism is, ""Would a bloody war not harm re-election chances way more than they'd help?"". The answer to this, is of course, in the affirmative. But here I speculate that Israel expects to hit its target list and sue for peace quickly, hoping that an Iranian desire to get sanctions relief and a Trump-Rouhani meeting come the UNGA will encourage Iran to rein Hezbollah in. In other words, I believe Israel thinks it can get a quick, nice, and tidy victory from this.

However, if reality will be this tidy is another matter entirely and something that is definitely outside the scope of this post.


Edit: Another possibility floated in the comments that I hadn't considered is an Iranian false flag. Although I think it is extremely unlikely, if the Hezbollah response ends up being very excessive then this becomes more likely. As of now, I expect a conciliatory, minimum ""please don't bomb us"" response which would make a false flag nonsensical.

Post-Skirmish Edit: It seems Scenario 1, which is usually the most likely scenario in the region,  came to be. So I'm chalking up my prediction as 'wrong' in the short term, but the trends I outlined still exist for at least the medium term. So I hope that this write up helped you understand some motivations behind this intractable conflict, despite the specifics of timing being wrong,

Final Edit: Haaretz is reporting that the armored vehicle that Hezbollah targeted was **not** remotely operated and actually had troops inside. Post-event videos also show that both Kornet rockets narrowly missed their target. So I'm suddenly much more comfortable with my analysis,  and I'm also very grateful to God that we narrowly missed this bullet (pun not intended). I have close to no doubt in my mind that if an Israeli soldier got 'scratched', we'd be in a very different situation today."

Sub Needs Stricter Monitoring of Non-Article Submissionss,612,0.91,h0kbpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/h0kbpu/sub_needs_stricter_monitoring_of_nonarticle/,93,2020-6-11,"This isn't going to be focused on one nationality, because I will take examples from a variety of topics. The main problems with non-article submission vs article submission  are the following

1. Overall poor quality post
2. Topics are so broad discussion become meaningless
3. A poorly researched post can lead to unhinged discussion

These can also happen with article submissions, but are much less likely due to article putting a fence around the discussion, or was written by expert in the field.

You see a lot of uncivil and misinformed comments in an article post, but what you are far less likely to see is whole discussion going down a rabbit hole.

**OVERALL POOR QUALITY POST**

Here are two post that are of poor quality

1. [Questions on the Influence and Role of Overseas Chinese](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/grvynu/questions_on_the_influence_and_role_of_overseas/?sort=new)
2. [How does protecting shipping lanes help project power?](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gtbygj/how_does_protecting_shipping_lanes_help_project/)

THe first post isn't a good post, because the OP never specified how relevant it was to geopolitics. Secondly, the responses were very personal.  The second was a bad question, because to be honest the main role of Navy isn't always to protect sea lanes. If you want to project power, you project power.

**TOPICS ARE SO BROAD DISCUSSIONS BECOME MEANINGLESS**

This sub has a tendency to think they are smarter than they actually are.  Here is a good example

[What role has Islam played in the hindrance of development of most Muslim nations?](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gy548n/what_role_has_islam_played_in_the_hindrance_of/)

The question is so broad that it become meaningless. Furthermore, let be honest here, how many economist would tell a government lets change the religion of a country to see if it boast economic growth?

It is these post that destroy the already low reputation of this sub. It invites a lot of people who are Islamophobes. Secondly, most of the scholars like Huntington who OP mentions don't know much about Islam and aren't economist / sociologist.

**POORLY RESEARCHED POST CAN LEAD TO UNHINGED DISCUSSION**

Often post are poorly researched, and can lead to people going down a rabbit hole.  This is a good example

[Thoughts on the rise of Pan-Anglo-Saxonism and the potential for an unification of the five eyes Anglo countries in the future](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gm25l2/thoughts_on_the_rise_of_pananglosaxonism_and_the/),

The OP thought that Pan Anglo-Saxonism was a way to counter Hispanization in the US, and the US would take the lead. The other commentators than resorted to calling his ideas racist. The whole discussion detached from reality, because politicians generally don't use the term Anglo-saxonism.

The proper term is Anglosphere, and most of its leading proponents come from outside the US (ie UK, Canada, Australia). One of the advocates is [Boris Johnson](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/24/boris-johnson-dreams-anglosphere-european-union-empire-colonialism/)

The Anglosphere  isn't racial, but linguistic. Recently there was the British discussion to grant BNO passport holders in Hong Kong a possible pathway to citizenship in the UK. It was the older (and whiter) generation of British that you find the most support for this idea

**There are a lot of non-article post have these problems.**

I would say 90% of the problems with non-article submissions could be solved by replacing it with an article submission.  Here are some examples of what articles that can be used in their place.

[What role has Islam played in the hindrance of development of most Muslim nations?](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gy548n/what_role_has_islam_played_in_the_hindrance_of/) could be replaced with [Can economic stagnation in the Middle East be reversed?](https://www.cfr.org/news-releases/can-economic-stagnation-middle-east-be-reversed). This article is a CFR article. There are other articles in a similar vain like [The Middle East’s Lost Decades: Development, Dissent, and the Future of the Arab World](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2019-10-15/middle-easts-lost-decades).  Using such an article is useful, because they set the parameters of the discussion, and the writers have an idea of what they are talking about. The problem with using Islam, you have Indonesia that on a 50-70 year time line have done as well as countries in East Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan and China) on % growth of per capita income basis.  Than there are the Muslim countries in the former USSR, which really should be lumped with ex-Soviet Republics. What about Muslim majority countries in sub-saharan Africa

The post [Thoughts on the rise of Pan-Anglo-Saxonism and the potential for an unification of the five eyes Anglo countries in the future](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gm25l2/thoughts_on_the_rise_of_pananglosaxonism_and_the/) could be replaced with  [The rise of the Anglosphere: how the right dreamed up a new conservative world order](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/02/rise-anglosphere-how-right-dreamed-new-conservative-world-order) The article is a New Statesmen article.

China seen from a historical perspective,611,0.83,i76fam,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/i76fam/china_seen_from_a_historical_perspective/,473,2020-8-10,"The geographical area which we call China is a vast territory of different landscapes and cultures.   It is bigger than the whole of Europe. However, we tend to label all the people who live in that area as Chinese. Since the entire landmass is dominated by a central government called China, it is natural for us to call it that way. However, it was not always so. 

In reality, China, as Europe after the Roman Empire, was broken into multiple states with different cultures and languages. People from Canton could easily have evolved into a completely different and independent nation, whereas people from Hubei could have formed their own state. The language barrier persists to this day. Therefore, saying that China speaks Chinese is like saying Europe speaks European. In fact, just as French and Spanish are different languages, Cantonese ans Beijing Chinese (mandarin) are different. And we are not including, say, Tibetan or Uighur. 

After centuries of division, the enormity of China came to be united by foreign conquerors, namely the Mongols. Just as the British Raj (which was an alien rule) formed modern India, the Mongols united several kingdoms into one central state. Of course, the Empire did not last and it was overthrown by Han nationalists. The new Han state was called Ming and they were introverted and confined themselves to the ancient territory of the Han empire (which is about 1/2 or 1/3 of modern China). 

Then came the Manchus, another horseback riding tribe, and they conquered the whole of Ming proper. But they did not stop. They conquered Mongolia, Tibet and the land of the Uighurs, thus forming what is today China’s territory. The Manchu state was a rather loose confederation granting extensive autonomy to non-Han peoples while placing the Han under strict control. Then came the Europeans and the Manchu state learned that they had to build a nation-state. However, that was difficult when there was a myriad of different peoples in the Empire. 

After the revolution which brought down the Manchus in 1911, the new Chinese republic learned that a confederate empire was untenable and they sought to build a modern nation state instead. Such a project, by definition, meant that the new Chinese republic had to unify its language and culture by forcing a national education and a national institution. This is the core of China’s current geopolitical problem. 

For comparison, let’s pretend that the ottoman empire somehow miraculously survived and tried to build a nation-state preserving all its conquered territories. The ottoman empire will speak Ottoman instead of Arabic or Greek and all political/social/cultural center would be concentrated in Turkey, not Egypt or Serbia. Of course, such a scenario never happened. Yet, the Chinese republic succeeded in this due to that the absolute majority of the population was culturally Han Chinese whereas the Turkish were a minority in their own empire. 

Nevertheless, the process of nationalization of the empire is not yet complete, and that is the root cause of China’s current geopolitical problem.

EDIT1: The whole argument is based on two books about the history of China. 

(Japanese) Okamoto Takashi, ""History of China from a world history perspective"", 岡本隆司, 世界史とつなげて学ぶ 中国全史

(Japanese) Okata Hiroshi, ""History of Chinese civilization"", 岡田英弘, 中国文明の歴史

EDIT2: for more detailed argument about the origin of modern Chinese nationalism refer to the post below
https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/i7hy9f/the_birth_of_modern_chinese_nationalism/

EDIT3: China is actually smaller than Europe as a whole. Sorry for the mistake

EDIT4: To clarify a bit, after the fall of Tang dynasty, northern China was ruled by foreign nations (Kitai & Jurchen) and they did not regard themselves to be Chinese. The upholders of Han-ness (akin to *Romanitas* in the west) were driven south forming the state of Song. This division lasted a few hundred years, which is enough for making two different entities. But this situation changed when the Mongols came and overran both the Jurchen and the Song, thus uniting the whole landmass into one central authority. The Mongols never pretended to be Chinese and they actually ruled China from Beijing via Muslims and Persians. In fact, Beijing itself was built by a Muslim from central Asia. Moreover, there was a sizable christian population in Beijing during this period, including one Catholic diocese. This is why the Ming (Han Chinese) were so opposed to the Mongols and became extremely introverted (with the exception of Yongle emperor who is a very extraordinary figure). The Ming expelled all foreigners and Christians (Nestorians and Catholics). But the contribution of the Mongols is that they created the notion of one big super state, a *Great State*. For details about the argument please refer to Timothy Brook's last book *""Great State: China and the World.""(2019)* After the Mongols fell, for over two hundred years, Manchuria, Tibet, and Mongolia were ruled by their own kingdoms. Then the Manchus conquered them all and built a universal empire. As long as the empire's subjects respected the authority of the Manchus, local customs were maintained and well protected. It was a complex relationship. The Manchus sent orders written in Manchu (not Chinese) to Manchu officials in Mongolia and Xinjiang whereas they pretended to be the traditional celestial emperor in front of Han Chinese. The Manchu emperor was Han (title for king in Manchu), Khan (title for king in Mongolian), Bodhisattva (Buddha reincarnated in front of the Tibetans) and Celestial Emperor (in front of the Han Chinese) all at the same time. So different ruling methods were used for different cultures. But such multicultural policy had to be brought down in order to create a modern state. Even the Manchus realized that and they knew they were a minority in number and they had to co-opt the Han Chinese. During the Taiping revolution of the 19th century, for the first time in its history, the Manchus gave military command to Han Chinese officials to crush the Taiping. The process of *Hanification* of the empire began only after the Taiping. And it ultimately culminated in the Chinese revolution of 1911.

EDIT5: The Manchus considered themselves *the rightful heirs of Genghis Khan* and the reason why they conquered Xinjiang was because that was the place where the last independent Mongolian kingdom - the Zhunghars -  fled. The Manchus had to bring them down to establish solid authority over the whole Mongol world. In short, the Manchu empire was more like the successor of the Yuan rather than Ming. But all of that changed with the advent of the Europeans and the Taiping. The Manchus came to be seen as weak and the Han Chinese took notice."

"Russia does not fear a US Military invasion, it fears liberalization",600,0.91,cb6iyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/cb6iyv/russia_does_not_fear_a_us_military_invasion_it/,163,2019-7-10,"Russia has been constantly stating their concerns of American antiballistic missile capabilities, strike weapon capability, and the border creeping up to NATO. Russia has been claiming NATO is an offensive military against Russia and that Russia must buy these advanced weapons now.

But is this really? First off, Russia even with the fall of the Soviet Union, is a nuclear weapons state with thousands of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. Even a limited American incursion such as seizing Kalinigrad or Crimea could be met with hundreds of tactical nuclear weapons on NATO forces. Sure America has the more advanced weapons and may ""win"" as in come out on top in a non-city nuclear exchange, but why would America risk it? Historically, empires expand when they are desperate. The Romans needed loot and land to make up for farmland plundered by Hannibal, the British needed carve up the world as a a sea-power to compete with larger European land economic powers. The Nazis needed to expand into the Soviet Union for security, living space, oil and food. But the United States has no reason to attack Russia, it has the food, tech, oil, security, minerals, it won't risk even a conventional war against a foe like North Korea and Iran unless they were attacked first. Even in a conventional fight, where Russia held off nukes, Russia could tens of thousands of American troops, a war started by the US simply isn't worth it.

So why is this concern really? Historically, Russia has had a bad history of liberalization under the Yeltsin administration, where individuals were corrupt and the nation was starving. In comes Putin, coming up with reforms of controlling the Oligarchs and winning a victory in Chechyna against Islamic sepratists. Putin and George Bush got along at first, but concerns of American withdraw of ABM Treaty along with the US invasion of Middle Eastern states, gave Russia the feeling that US was pushing around its weight and reinforcing a cultural hegemony that could decide world affairs and break apart Russian economic partners. Combined with the Orange Revolution and the Euromaiden, Putin fears that these liberal revolts will spark one in Russia where the Putin regime would be overthrown.

So why the hate for NATO? Well NATO has had a history of increasingly expanding. Poland is known to be one of the members that angered Russia. Poland's economy saw rapid rise, and they could keep their military spending effective for they buy arms for the United States(cheaper). That means more money can be invested in the economy. This could happen to other Eastern European states as well such as Ukraine and Greece increasingly buying Western arms. Combined with the volumes of investment along with sanctions, Russia fears that the Eastern states will spread propaganda of ""the West is so much better than Nationalism, look at all this cool stuff I bought"", which could lead to a ""colored revolution of Russia"" which will lead to the deposition of the Putin regime.

Are Russia's concerns legit or is it just being a sorry loser? Is US right for ecouraging globalization? Or is it just being a bully pushing around less territorial fortunate states?"

The most recent IFs index was updated in 2016 and contains projections for every year up to 2100. The GPI weighs countries by Economy (35%), Military (25%), Political Influence (20%), Population (10%) and Technology (10%) using various sub-metrics within each category to produce an overall rating.

In 2020, the Top 20 projected nations were as follows:

1. **United States**: 22.4% of global power
2. **China**: 15.1%
3. **Japan**: 5.2%
4. **Germany**: 4.8%
5. **France**: 4.7%
6. **United Kingdom**: 4.1%
7. **Russia**: 4.0%
8. **India:** 3.7%
9. **Brazil:** 2.1%
10. **Italy:** 2.0%
11. **Canada:** 1.9%
12. **Australia:** 1.6%
13. **South Korea**: 1.5%
14. **Saudi Arabia**: 1.5%
15. **Spain:** 1.5%
16. **Netherlands:** 1.3%
17. **Mexico:** 1.0%
18. **Indonesia:** 1.0%
19. **Turkey:** 0.9%
20. **Israel:** 0.8%

Generally, the relative positioning looks fairly accurate in my opinion. If anybody has questions about the methodology or comments to add ask below. I also have a spreadsheet of past and projected ratings if there is interest. Some interesting side-notes about the index:

* The USA surpassed Britain as the world's top power in 1897 in terms of material capabilities.
* Prior to WW2, Germany and the US were the primary powers (\~21% each), with the Soviet Union and British Empire close behind (\~15% each)
* The UK was at its zenith in world power during the 1820s.
* US Global Power peaked in 1951 at 50%.
* China will supposedly overtake the US in 2030.
* There will be three 'Great Powers' during the 21st century consisting of China, the US and India (as well as the EU if fully integrated)

Some thoughts on the evolving pro-Chinese presence in this subreddit [Meta],544,0.93,b2quz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/b2quz3/some_thoughts_on_the_evolving_prochinese_presence/,309,2019-3-19,"By now I'm sure quite a few of us have read the Buzzfeed News article about Reddit and this subreddit in particular being a place where discourse has been increasingly ""pro-Chinese"". I've been part of this subreddit for about 3 years now, and for better or worse my area of interest (being Chinese geopolitics and China related military development) and my activity on this subreddit has given me some slight profile, where I now feel obliged to discuss this elephant in the room. I've contacted /u/dieyoufool3 regarding this post and he's given me the nod to make it. I don't want to step on the mod team's toes and I think they've done a good job of running the subreddit overall to allow a variety of different arguments compete and be reviewed on the basis of the logic and merit of the arguments themselves. This may end up being a bit of a long textpost, so I apologize for that.

*Edit: seeing as I'm receiving a few comments about this -- I do not necessarily endorse or agree with the contents of the full Buzzfeed News article. However I do think it is a useful springboard for talking about what some people in this subreddit and on Reddit overall have been complaining about. To make it clear, the extent of my opinion is that this subreddit is technically more ""pro-China"" i.e.: less ""anti-China"" than the rest of Reddit tends to be. I lay this out in one of the paragraphs in point 1, however I want to put it clearly out here so no one misses it.*

======

This subreddit is a public space where competing ideas exist, but that nature means it is possible for third parties to try and artificially alter the route and form of the community's discussion and debate without participating it in good faith or without constructively contributing. I see three main challenges for the mod team here (but also indeed for any subreddit or community):

1. Intent of the user
2. Boundaries of discourse
3. Brigading and vote manipulation

I've been ruminating about this China specific issue on this subreddit for a while now. Part of the reason is because I have definitely noticed this subreddit has having a larger amount of individuals who are ""pro-Chinese"" than most average/default subreddits on Reddit. Another part of the reason is because I myself have been accused of being a propagandist, a wumao, a shill or a troll in the past as well. I'm aware of at least one individual who has even followed me on this account and created a subreddit to commentate and mock my activity. So I think now is a good time to start talking about the China discourse here openly. To start off;

&#x200B;

**1, Intent of the user:**

* This refers to whether a user on the subreddit is a real person who is part of this ""community"" and is interested in constructively contributing to it, rather than someone ""outside"" of the community, such as bots (which are obviously not people) or foreign ""shills"" (where their posts and contributions are a result of being paid or incentivized to post things they themselves may not believe in). Obviously for any community, the desire is to only have real people who are interested in having a genuine discussion.
* I imagine the mod team may have some resources to be able to identify which users are bots and/or replica accounts. I'm not sure if this may include IP identification or if it is more primitive like simply checking the history of the user (e.g.: many low effort contributions from day old accounts).
* Unfortunately, I think it's much more difficult to identify ""shills"" because it is impossible to identify an individual who is being paid to post about a particular belief or argument versus an individual who does genuinely believe about said belief or argument. Some people may suggest one way of tracking such individuals is by looking through their history, and if their post and comment history only revolves around discussing a particular set of topics, it may be a useful indicator to identify a ""shill"". On first glance that is not illogical, however I also think there are more than a few people who have used dedicated accounts to talk about these issues because they are interested in it -- in fact this particular account I've been using for the last few years is one I deliberately created to only talk about China related geopolitics and PLA developments, because my main Reddit account is one I use to browse other lighter, less intense topics (obviously I leave the two accounts well segregated). My main Reddit account also has some comments where it may be possible for me to be doxxed, and I'm sure I don't need to explain my caution around how some of my posts or comments may be received by some individuals who could end up being genuinely hostile.
* It is very easy to call someone you disagree with a shill, or a troll, a bot or a wumao or a propagandist, or brainwashed. I avoid doing so, because when that card is pulled, it is essentially the equivalent of forfeiting the argument as well as suggesting that the other person across the screen you are debating with is not a genuine person with genuine opinions. In a place where the purpose is to have constructive discussion, dismissing a person's belief in their opinion as fabricated is among the most egregious and low effort statements one can make.
* Finally, I feel obliged to speculate about the noted higher prevalence of ""pro-Chinese"" users on this subreddit versus the rest of the website (though I certainly don't think that group of users is anywhere near a majority of the 140k people here). People have understandably been concerned if this subreddit might be targeted by Chinese govt influence groups. Based on my time in the subreddit as well as based on a few people who have contacted me in the past, I hypothesize the higher prevalence of ""pro-Chinese"" users here is a reflection of greater interest in ""geopolitical"" matters from the overseas Chinese community in contemporary times compared to the past.
* Some people may have guessed this in the past, but I do have Chinese heritage in me (I won't disclose if it's part, half or whole), and as someone living in a ""western nation"" I have of course observed the way in which news media and commentary have written about China within the last decade or more (often in a context of power trajectory and/or geopolitics). That environment that in turn has led me to be interested in China related geopolitics. I obviously do not speak for all individuals with Chinese heritage, but I've been contacted by a few on this account who have described a similar trajectory of interest. In short, I wonder if Chinese individuals of a certain era living in the English speaking world may be on average more interested in geopolitics than other demographic groups on average -- and on Reddit the cross section of that means there may be a higher proportion of /r/geopolitics users of a Chinese background than elsewhere on Reddit, relatively speaking. However this is merely a hypothesis and not any sort of watertight argument. It is also very possible that this subreddit do not have a greater proportion individuals of a Chinese background than the rest of Reddit, but it merely attracts individuals who have a certain way of thinking or a worldview that causes this subreddit to seem more pro-Chinese than the rest of Reddit.

&#x200B;

**2, Boundaries of discourse**

* The moderators are free to choose what the boundaries of discussion are on this subreddit, which I think is an authority we do respect. The complex problem that is posed to them, is where to set those boundaries.
* Obviously everyone would agree that things like advocating for violence or genocide or denying the occurrence of historical atrocities would very much be beyond the pale. Similarly, posts including offensive language and personal attacks are also not appropriate for a subreddit with standards.
* But there are obviously many other topics were a range of opinions exist and consensus does not exist. For China related topics (given the focus of this post), this may include interpretations of the Tiananmen protests in 1989, to the legitimacy of the CCP and the Chinese govt, to the nature of the Chinese economy, as well as some more recent heated issues like Chinese re-education efforts in Xinjiang and the social credit system in the country. On the larger scale, topics of debate like the nature of the international legal order, the balance of power of the UN, the fairness of international financial institutions, are various other contentious topics we've seen debated here.
* Individuals of differing backgrounds will have differing opinions about a range of topics. Our opinions and worldviews are a reflection of the way we were socialized by family, friends, media, history and education. To my understanding, I believe this subreddit is open to having opinions from a range of different backgrounds contribute so long as they remain within clear boundaries. I do not believe this subreddit is an ""echo chamber"" that only exclusively pushes a single nation or group's views on all issues. In my opinion this is a good thing, because to have proper discussion about geopolitics one cannot merely only hear what you yourself believe but also what to hear what other groups believe. I myself have learned a lot from a number of users in this subreddit from different backgrounds, including people whose opinions I initially may have disagreed with.
* However, I also appreciate that sometimes merely allowing the debate of certain topics leads to the normalization of certain discourses. Something that was previously seen as completely indefensible may, after some debate, be seen as perhaps not entirely unreasonable under a certain set of circumstances.
* Wherever the moderators choose to set the boundaries either now or in the future, it is an unenviable task.

&#x200B;

**3, Brigading and vote manipulation**

* We all know what brigading and vote manipulation means. I'm not sure if other places have ever coordinated to deliberately manipulate votes or alter contributions or comments here. If so, that is obviously undesirable. I'm not sure how easy it is for the moderators to track this behaviour, but it is somewhat related to the issues of user intent from point 1.
* The infamous case of Unidan also showed us how easy it is for a few alt accounts to alter the vote trajectory of certain comments and to make them obscure. As a matter of principle I do not downvote comments that I disagree with or comments that I am engaged in a debate with. However receiving downvoting due to genuine individuals who disagree with a particular comment also happens, and I imagine it is difficult to distinguish that versus coordinated vote manipulation.
* The votes of a post or comment tend to be perceived as reflecting the amount of support it has. This is inherently tied to whether the contributing upvotes or downvotes to a certain post is a reflection of outside vote manipulation or if it a reflection of the actual demographics of the genuine user base. Hypothetically, if there was a way to determine that the votes of a comment or post are the result of the genuine user base, then the question to be asked is how comfortable the moderator team is in having that proportion of their user base holding those views -- i.e.: tying back to point 2.

=====

Given this subreddit is meant to talk about geopolitics, it is almost impossible to talk about geopolitics without occasionally talking about China related geopolitical events. Naturally there will be debate that follows.

I appreciate that a good portion of this subreddit's userbase likely resides in the western, English speaking world (with a higher proportion from that demographic as part of Reddit's overall userbase). It is likely that many of the arguments made from users of a Chinese background, seem alien and perhaps even outrageous to the extent that they are perceived as being made from professional propagandists. I have no solution for those kind of concerns, and it is up to the moderator team or even Reddit admin to consider how much range of debate this subreddit should have for the complex and international topic that is geopolitics (not only China related topics but all topics in future).

But personally, in my time here I've found this subreddit to overwhelmingly be a place of genuine debate about genuine ideas from genuine people. I do my best to contribute constructively and to use language that is not overly emotive, and I think many people here do so as well. I hope this subreddit can remain so in the future."

Now they're kind of like the USA, utterly massive and with an industrial and manpower advantage over other countries on a scale that's absolutely silly. 

Are there other sleeping tigers out there? Obviously India, but they're half awake already, more of a sleep walking tiger you could say.

**The US is orchestrating a far-reaching campaign against China.**

[Full video: Vice President Pence's Remarks on US Policy Towards China](https://youtu.be/aeVrMniBjSc?t=736)

Did Cold War II break out last week while no one was watching? As the Kavanaugh confirmation battle raged, many Americans missed what looks like the biggest shift in U.S.-China relations since Henry Kissinger’s 1971 visit to Beijing.

The Trump administration’s China policy swam into view, and it’s a humdinger. Vice President Mike Pence gave a guide to the approach in a speech last week at the Hudson Institute (where I am a fellow). Denouncing what he called China’s “whole of government” approach to its rivalry with the U.S., Mr. Pence vowed the Trump administration will respond in kind. He denounced China’s suppression of the Tibetans and Uighurs, its “Made in China 2025” plan for tech dominance, and its “debt diplomacy” through the Belt and Road initiative. The speech sounded like something Ronald Reagan could have delivered against the Soviet Union: Mr. Xi, tear down this wall! Mr. Pence also detailed an integrated, cross-government strategy to counter what the administration considers Chinese military, economic, political and ideological aggression.

In the same week as the vice president’s speech, Navy plans for greatly intensified patrols in and around Chinese-claimed waters in the South China Sea were leaked to the press. Moreover, the recently-entered trilateral U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement was revealed to have a clause discouraging trade agreements between member countries and China. The administration indicated it would seek similar clauses in other trade agreements. Also last week, Congress approved the Build Act, a $60 billion development-financing program designed to counter China’s Belt and Road strategy in Africa and Asia. Finally, the White House issued a report highlighting the danger that foreign-based supply chains pose to U.S. military capabilities in the event they are cut off during a conflict.
Any one of these steps would have rated banner headlines in normal times; in the Age of Trump, all of them together barely registered. But this is a major shift in American foreign policy. As China responds, and as other countries formulate their approaches to the emerging U.S.-China rivalry, a new international reality will take shape. With many longtime U.S. allies opposed to the Trump administration on trade policy and other matters, and with Russia, North Korea and Iran all looking to frustrate U.S. goals, an indignant China looking for opportunities to make Washington pay may find help.

American businesses engaged directly or indirectly with China could face difficulties as the U.S. strategy is implemented. American presidents have broad authority over trade and investment related to national security. Donald Trump has already used this to threaten and impose tariffs and Mr. Pence warned that even higher tariffs are on the way. The White House report highlighting supply-chain vulnerabilities could provide the basis for new and more far-reaching restrictions.
Business and investors may still be underestimating both the Trump administration’s determination to challenge China and the amount of economic disruption that greater U.S.-China tension can bring. To the mix of longtime China hawks and trade hawks now driving U.S. policy, national security matters more than economic friction, and many of the protestations from the U.S. business community may fall on deaf ears. Both China and the U.S. are likely to move quickly, unpredictably and disruptively as they struggle for advantage; Wall Street should brace itself for further shocks.
In terms of domestic politics, the new and more confrontational policy is likely to be broadly popular. Mr. Trump’s populist base resents the “theft” of American jobs, and human-rights and religious-freedom advocates are increasingly troubled by China’s severe repression at home and support for authoritarian regimes abroad. The foreign-policy establishment may oppose Mr. Trump’s tactics, but it generally accepts the need for a stronger stance against China. Businesses will be split; while some are heavily exposed to a potential deterioration in U.S.-China relations, others are angry about stolen intellectual property, resent restrictions on their access to Chinese markets, or fear competition from subsidized Chinese firms.

Democrats who have relished attacking Mr. Trump for allegedly being soft on Vladimir Putin will have a hard time explaining why a hard line on Russia is a patriotic duty but a tough China policy is a mistake. Things could change if the economic and political costs of confrontation rise, but at least initially the new China policy has encountered little opposition.

Replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement, reshaping the Supreme Court, and launching a new Cold War in the same week is quite the trifecta. America may or may not be on the road to greatness under Mr. Trump, but it is certainly going somewhere, and at an accelerating pace.

While most media attention on China focuses on China’s relationship with the US, one player that rarely gets mentioned--at least in mainstream Western media--is India. 

In an [October 2019 analysis by Deborah Brautigam](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337816614_A_critical_look_at_Chinese_'debt-trap_diplomacy'_the_rise_of_a_meme) that explored the origin of the term ""debt trap diplomacy"" for Chinese investments, she revealed the following:

> On 23 January 2017, **a Chinese debt-trap diplomacy meme was born in a think tank in northern India** and was furthered by a paperwritten by two Harvard University graduate students who called it Chinese ‘debt book diplo-macy’.

A [recent thread on r/china revealed some surprising data](https://reddit.com/r/China/comments/gercr9/countries_which_are_tweeting_about_tweetfortaiwan/) (non-academic, I know, but it's a good barometer for general sentiment on China as many of the more critical stories regarding China has first emerged on that sub, and then slowly propagated out towards more mainstream subs/media). Namely--by analyzing 449 tweets with the hashtag of #TweetforTaiwan, it found that 49% of the tweets originated from India. 

Most recently, *Times of India* has also advocated for Taiwan's participation in the WHO by interviewing the foreign minister of Taiwan--which has since drawn [an official statement](http://in.china-embassy.org/eng/embassy_news/t1773944.htm) from the Chinese embassy in India.

But most importantly, India has recently announced that it is setting aside [nearly half a million hectares of land](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3082892/india-lure-firms-fleeing-china-land-offering-nearly-double) to entice foreign firms into leaving China. 

PM Modi has also emphasized that he had little desire for India to [play second fiddle to China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/11/08/modi-wont-let-china-turn-india-to-another-pakistan/#5c0cd7746ebf). While some can argue that this is due to him pandering to the Hindu nationalist base that makes up his supporters, it's not a statement to be taken lightly because the BJP--by taking a supermajority in the Indian Congress--is in a position to enact its policies at will without regard for the opposition.

#The Trade Reality of India vis-a-vis the United States#

You can read the [US trade department's 2019 analysis](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2019_National_Trade_Estimate_Report.pdf) of India here. It's a fairly dense read, but the basic summary is this:

> The United States has actively sought bilateral and multilateral opportunities to increase access to India’s market, and the government of India has pursued ongoing economic reform efforts. Nevertheless, U.S. exporters continue to encounter significant tariff and nontariff barriers that impede imports of U.S. products into India.

Other points raised in the document:

- India maintains very high tariffs on a number of goods--some as high as 150%. 
- India has increased tariffs in 2018 key U.S. exports in the agricultural, information and communications technology, and automobile parts sectors, with no warning or public consultation process.
- India maintains several export subsidy programs to boost production in domestic sectors
- India remains on the Priority Watch List due to weak protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights
- The Indian government maintains strong ownership presence in major services industries such as banking and insurance. 
- Foreign investment in businesses in certain major services sectors, including financial services and retail, is subject to limitations on foreign equity.

The document goes on to list additional trade barriers that India has put up against the United States, and they are far too many to list here. But taken as a whole, the overall summary seems to be this: **India--from a trade policy perspective--is not that much different or even that advantageous compared to China.**

Yet in the face of greater US-China economic rivalry, India has emerged as a seemingly viable alternative to China despite data suggesting the contrary.

This is due to the major advantage India has over China, which I will discuss in the next section.

#The Advantages India Holds Over China#

**ADVANTAGE 1: ONLINE PRESENCE** 

The biggest advantage that India holds over China in an economic cold war has little to do with any underlying economic strength, nor does it have anything to do with how easy it is for foreign companies to enter India. 

Instead, the biggest advantage India has over China is *its online presence in the Western internet*. [With 560 million internet users]( https://www.statista.com/topics/2157/internet-usage-in-india/), India is the second largest online market after China. But unlike China, India’s internet is not locked behind a government imposed barrier. 

The lack of such a barrier has given rise to a sophisticated disinformation/propaganda arm for Indian political parties—most notably the BJP—on Western internet channels such as Twitter and Facebook. 

The [Centre for International Governance Innovation](https://www.cigionline.org/articles/how-bjp-used-technology-secure-modis-second-win) think tank has done the following analysis of how the BJP’s propaganda arm makes use of Western social media to set the narrative:

- The grassroots workers share hyperlocal information about development activities — for instance, a beneficiary getting access to services offered under a government scheme — and work done by their party with voters in their area. They click images and videos as proof and circulate to demonstrate that the party cares about local issues.
- The party foot soldiers broadcast their mobilization efforts to their superiors in the party, earning praise and encouragement from the leadership.
- The networked system allows the party command to centrally share information through the chain of WhatsApp groups being operated — bypassing the editorial filter of news media.
- On Twitter, an army of online warriors takes part in the narrative-setting game. Even though Twitter usage is largely restricted to the country’s elites, journalists and influencers hang out on the micro-blogging platform, meaning the sentiment smoothly seeps into the wider information ecosystem.

Basically, India has coopted the Western internet and used it to their advantage, while China has taken the approach of shutting out the Western internet altogether in favor of cultivating its own walled garden. 

This means that China's closed off internet ecosystem is incapable of effectively competing with India's online presence. Moreover, Chinese netizens who do manage to overcome the barriers can find themselves facing state suppression and persecution. This limits Chinese disinformation methods to either state media, or state-sanctioned individuals who often must be vetted for political loyalty before they are set loose. This level of political control and loyalty that China demands has severely limited its ability to project its message outside of the Chinese internet. 

The ability for India's different political parties to set the narrative gives India a crucial advantage when it comes to either spreading pro-Indian messages or smearing potential adversaries. 

**ADVANTAGE 2: MAINTAINING A SUPPORTIVE DIASPORA**

Indian Americans maintain a high degree of connection to their motherland (for lack of a better term), and this data is supported by [India being the top remittance-receiving country in 2018]( https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/forex-and-remittance/india-to-retain-top-position-in-remittances-with-80-billion-world-bank/articleshow/66998062.cms?from=mdr). 

While Chinese immigrants maintain a similar level of connection to their motherland (China ranks second after India in the top remittance-receiving countries in 2018 from the same *Times of India* report), a prevailing attitude of Chinese diaspora has been one of [pride for their homeland but suspicion for the government]( https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/2155747/question-facing-chinese-diaspora-love-country-or-party):

> Many overseas Chinese have shown pride in the considerable economic achievements China has made over the past four decades, allowing it to become the world’s second largest economy. On the other hand, they also harbour deep-rooted suspicion and disapproval of the party’s authoritarian approach and its intolerance towards dissent or media freedom.
>
> Hence, when talking politics, those overseas Chinese like to highlight that their love of country is in no way related to a love of the Communist Party.

As the CCP increasingly demand that supporting China be intertwined with supporting the CCP—a message that the party can control and foster only within its walled garden—it is more likely to drive overseas Chinese further away from supporting the party’s policies. 

In 2019, the ""Howdy Modi"" convention in Houston, Texas [drew a crowd of 50,000](https://theconversation.com/howdy-modi-in-houston-why-indias-narendra-modi-puts-so-much-effort-into-wooing-the-diaspora-123946). It's difficult to imagine a similar number of supporters if a CCP politician were to announce a similar trip.

The popularity Indian politicians like Modi can expect in the West, coupled with an effective propaganda wing from within India that has a massive presence on social media to set the narrative gives India a tremendous advantage in maintaining a high degree of loyalty in its diaspora population. This diaspora can later prove to be a useful tool in advancing Indian foreign policy by amplifying the messages from within India. 

**Disclaimer:** this by no means implies that Hindu Indian Americans are acting as a fifth column to advance India's goals, but merely suggests that Hindu Indian Americans are likely to share and disseminate Indian propaganda--with or without realizing that they are doing so. 

#Can China Counter this?#

In the current information war, China is losing. Badly. By building a caged garden, China's information warriors are largely clueless as to how to effectively spread their propaganda. Two examples come to mind.

The first example was during the recent Hong Kong protests. China's attempt at controlling the narrative fell apart almost as quickly as it began, as many of its messages included support for party control, casting the protesters as Hong Kong independence provocateurs, or suggesting CIA influence rather than focusing on specific instances of targeted violence and xenophobic attacks on Mandarin speaking individuals (including [attacks on Taiwanese media]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojKm1Y7aL98)).

Another example is how China has been incapable of finding a way to reduce the influence of Falun Gong media such as the Epoch Times and New Tang Dynasty TV in the West. These channels can operate unimpeded from Chinese state repression on the Western internet, and when China *does* try and respond to them, the results often come across as clumsy and ham-fisted because attempts at control tend to follow Chinese internet control strategies. 
However, from experience, China can ill afford to relax its internet controls: both the 2008 Tibetan protests and the 2009 Urumqi attacks were organized through Facebook. Relaxing internet controls would also see the internet, both within and without China, be flooded with Chinese nationalists--a faction that Beijing has simultaneously encouraged and suppressed depending on the needs of the state. 

If China were to go on the information war offensive against India to retain its economic advantage, it must take a two-pronged approach:

- On the world stage, it would highlight the unfair trade practices of India to portray India in the same light as China in terms of negative trade practices.
- Within India, it would find local partners to sow the idea that India will be treated the same way as China by the West once it has developed enough.

**On highlighting the unfair trade practices of India:** The advantage that China holds in this regard is that the world has already formed a negative opinion on Chinese trade practices, therefore creating a situation in which China only has something to lose if other countries can offer a more attractive alternative. 

By depriving the world of seeing India as a viable alternative, China can join in international pressure to force the Indian economy to open up further without giving India the opportunity to develop an industrial base capable of protecting its fledgling industries. 

In such a scenario, China would be able to leverage its massive industrial capability into India and gobble up local Indian partners, or otherwise choose to support companies that would adopt pro-China practices. In essence, by attacking India before it can build an effective industrial base, China can enact a a softer version of the colonialist methods that the British used to subjugate India in the 19th century. This may possibly explain why the term ""debt trap diplomacy"" first emerged from an Indian think tank.

**On Using Local Indian Partners to Sow Ideas:** By partnering with local voices in India and sowing the idea that once India becomes developed enough, it would also face the same trade scrutiny that China has faced, China can attempt to pivot India away from developing friendlier ties to the West and return it towards its Non-Aligned status it adopted during the Cold War. However, these efforts can largely be stymied by government policy--and in fact, the [Modi government has required that Chinese investment into India be approved first](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/india-steps-up-scrutiny-on-investment-from-china-and-its-neighbours/articleshow/75219816.cms).

There is still a lot of room for the rivalry and/or partnership between China and India to continue developing in this coming decade. But it's clear that at the current moment, India seems to have a distinctive advantage."

"On Somaliland's recognition, perspective from a citizen of Somaliland.",514,0.98,685r46,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/685r46/on_somalilands_recognition_perspective_from_a/,68,2017-4-29,"I have stumbled upon a discussion on this subreddit that happened two weeks ago titled [Why is Somaliland not recognised as a sovereign state?](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/65iy0p/why_is_somaliland_not_recognised_as_a_sovereign/). It was very interesting for me to observe what the world thinks of my unknown 'country'. I noticed that there were no voices from Somaliland present in the discussion, so thought I would have a stab at providing some context as to why Somaliland is seeking independence. Which may help answering why it has not received one yet.

So, why does Somaliland seek to be independent? 

To understand the situation currently present, we have to go back to the year 1960. Somaliland was a [British protectorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Somaliland) whilst the rest of what is today known as Somalia was under under UN stewardship, having had a separate colonial history as an [Italian colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Somaliland). Prior to this, Somaliland and Somalia had no shared history as both were part of different kingdoms, [Adal in the case of Somaliland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adal_Sultanate) and [Ajuraan Sultanate in the case of Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajuran_Sultanate), plus many other tribal sultanates and fiefdoms. 

On 26 June 1960, Somaliland was granted independence by Great Britain and became an independent albeit short-lived state known as the [State of Somaliland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Somaliland) for 5 days before voluntarily choosing to unite with the former Italian colony of Somalia to form a union known as the Somali Republic. At the time, there was a strong sense of yearning for [Greater Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Somalia), a state that would be made up of all the five Somali regions in East Africa, namely Somaliland, Somalia, [Ogaden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_Region) (occupied by Ethiopia), Djibouti (occupied by France) and the [NFD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Eastern_Province_(Kenya)) (occupied by Kenya). Incidentally, this is why the Somalia flag has a five-pointed star.

No formal international treaty combining the two countries was ever signed, because northern and southern politicians could not agree on the terms of the Act of Union. The unification was instead decreed by the president of the new state, which was not technically constitutional. 

The union was a [disaster](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gk2QAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA212&dq=somalia+southerners+took+all+the+top+positions&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqysXXg8jTAhVC7BQKHXyIDf0Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=somalia%20southerners%20took%20all%20top%20positions&f=false) for Somaliland, there was no north-south power sharing agreement. Both the president and the prime minister were chosen from the south, the capital of the new state was Mogadishu, the capital of the south, and southerners took more than two thirds of senior cabinet posts and all the top positions in the military and police forces. It was almost a hostile takeover. 

Somalilanders were very unhappy with the union from the get go. They felt that as the senior partner of this union (Somaliland being the first Somali state to gain independence), they deserved a more equitable power-sharing deal. As a result of this dissatisfaction, the first major test of the new government, the 1961 constitutional referendum was [rejected](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v8i8jwp1pvcC&pg=PA128&dq=somaliland+reject+constitution+referendum+1961&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM8_6IhsjTAhUHQBQKHRBYAMEQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=somaliland%20reject%20constitution%20referendum%201961&f=false) in the north with the largest northern political party boycotting the referendum altogether. 

Resentment for the new state was clear among northerners, within one year of the union, in December 1961, a group of northern officers even attempt a coup to gain [succession](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v8i8jwp1pvcC&pg=PA128&dq=somaliland+reject+constitution+referendum+1961&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM8_6IhsjTAhUHQBQKHRBYAMEQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=somaliland%20reject%20constitution%20referendum%201961&f=false)  from the south. 

Fast forward to 1969, when a successful coup (by southerner military strongman Siad Barre) took the country down a path of dictatorship and authoritarian rule.

The south completely dominated the state and have deprived the northerners (Somaliland) from all development, so much so, that the allocated developmental assistance for the entire north was only [7%](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Sa2HDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA133&lpg=PA133&dq=&source=bl&ots=pO-vr1qvee&sig=d9iy8bTJZXguD8hXXsSjwgQA6dU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjf35jHq_TRAhVkF8AKHc58D-4Q6AEIGjAA#v=snippet&q=receiving%20under%207%20per%20cent%20of%20nationally%20disbursed%20development%20assistance&f=false).

All of this (and many other examples of depravation, social/political/economic marginalisation) led to the major clan of the north starting a rebellion in the north in 1981. They were not the first as another group in the east declared a rebellion in 1978 but they were contained by the Barre regime within a couple of years and later incorporated into the state by Barre. 

The northern rebellion turned into a militant movement known as [SNM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_National_Movement) with initial aims of removing Siad Barre from office. 

Barre responded with an act of [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaaq_genocide), levelling Somaliland's largest city (second largest city in Somalia) and many of its towns, and killing an estimated 50,000-200,000 Somalis from the north using the Somali army (think Bashar Asad). In a dystopian scene, Somali military aircraft would fly out of Hargeisa airport, make a u-turn, and come back to bomb the same city. Barre went as far as hiring ex-Rhodesian and South African mercenaries to help with the aerial bombardment of Somaliland cities. [Mass-grave sites](http://www.voanews.com/a/somaliland-opens-thirty-year-old-mass-graves-civil-war/3757516.html) are still found all over Somaliland to this day.

In 1989, another militant group (USC) started open rebellion against Siad Barre.

Siad Barre flees the country in 1991, the same year Somaliland calls for a grand meeting of all clans and decides to reclaim its independence. 

This is it. Fast forward 26 years and we are still here. 

That was a very rough timeline of the history leading up to Somaliland declaring independence. I hope you have a better understanding of what took place. And why Somaliland is actually seeking independence. 

As for why it did not receive it yet, this is a very difficult question for me to answer. My guess is that this is because Somaliland has no interesting political/economical capital for world powers, as such no 'champion' on the world stage. Both the US and UK have expressed sympathetic stances to Somaliland's quest for independence but both have refused to grant her independence and relegated the matter to the African Union and finding a solution 'with Somalia'. This would have been a problem for any other case, because usually, African countries do not look favourably upon 'separatists' due to the African Unions most important unwritten rule: Colonial borders are [sacrosanct](https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/156846/FULLTEXT01-7.pdf) and should not be tampered with in anyway. This is so a pandora's box isnt opened in Africa because almost each state has ethnic border issues due to the colonial history of our content.  Well, in 2005, the AU sent a [fact finding](http://www.somalilandlaw.com/AU_Fact-finding_Mission_to_Somaliland_2005_Resume.pdf) mission to Somaliland, the mission reported that: Somaliland’s case is a unique one, which should be judged “from an objective historical viewpoint and a moral angle vis-à-vis the aspirations of the people”. The AU mission recommended to “find a special method for dealing with Somaliland” and confirmed that Somaliland’s status was not “linked to the notion of opening a Pandora’s Box” in Africa. You see, Somaliland's borders are colonial, just like any other African state. So the quest for Somalialnd's independence does not go against AU red tape. Unfortunately, despite the fact-finding mission being very positive for Somaliland, the report  has been kept under wraps and is yet to be discussed by the AU executive council for possible adoption by the heads of state summit.

Furthermore, the South African Department of Foreign Affairs issued a [legal opinion](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8hcoBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT618&dq=%22undeniable+that+Somaliland+does+indeed+qualify+for+statehood%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigwa7CkMjTAhUMAcAKHbx0AjcQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=%22undeniable%20that%20Somaliland%20does%20indeed%20qualify%20for%20statehood%22&f=false) stating regarding Somaliland's independence: 
>""It is undeniable that Somaliland does indeed qualify for statehood, and it is incumbent on the international community to recognise it. Any efforts to deny or delay would not only put the international community at risk of ignoring the most stable region in the Horn, it would impose untold hardship upon the people of Somaliland due to the denial of foreign assistance that recognition entails.”

So legally, there isnt any big problems for Somaliland to gain independence, it ticks all all the boxes. But it seems there is no international appetite for its independence at the moment sadly. 

The other issue is the absence of a willing partner. Somalia has largely been ungovernable since the collapse of the Somali state in 1991. Different militia have dominion over different parts of the country, there are way too many cooks in that kitchen, you have various tribal militia, warlords, militant Islamists in a constant struggle for power. Add to that meddling from neighbouring countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, both of whom have a stake at Somalia not regaining stability and strong governance due to both of them worrying about Somali irredentism, Ethiopia's eastern region and Kenya's northern region are inhabited by Somalis. This resulted in all previous governments in Somalia not being able to control even their own capital city. And the further disintegration of Somalia into many different 'Federal' states, many of them existing in name only.

All of this meant that Somaliland has had no 'partner' in these negotiations. No one to talk to, and no one with the ability to offer any kind of settlement . Thus stuck in limbo. 

Ideally, a government that controls the south would be good news for Somaliland, they could maybe agree to a referendum to happen within Somaliland that decides the matter. But the longer Somalia is 'unavailable' to negotiate the longer Somaliland will have to wait to regain its independence. 

If you have any questions about Somaliland please ask away and I will try to answer as best as I can. 

**tl;dr: Somaliland was independent for 5 days, then voluntarily joined a union with Somalia. They had no shared history prior to this union and were part of different kingdoms/sultanates. Somaliland endured decades of economic/political/social marginalisation, culminating in an uprising/rebellion which was met by genocidal acts by the Somali state. Somaliland essentially won the civil war and declared independence, reclaiming its lost sovereignty. There has been no international appetite to grant Somaliland its independence despite her trying for the last 26 years. The long night continues.**

If conflict with the US escalated to the point of war wouldn't ICBM's, other aerial assets, and a large military presence in Northeast Asia make Chinese strength there of very limited value?

I've read there's oil in the region. But how valuable is it really, given the costs of underwater extraction, the higher supply from fraking and other new technologies, and lower demand due to alternate energy? It barely seems worth it, even before the international push back and additional vulnerabilities of building a lot of oil rigs is factored in.

Why does it matter if trillions of dollars in trade transverse the area? Whatever the economic or geopolitical gain, the diplomatic costs of using control of the sea to transgress the norms of freedom of navigation would be enormous and have a high chance of starting a war.

It's such a costly undertaking. It undermines China's ""peaceful rise"" strategy globally and severely antagonizes and complicates relations with other countries bordering the sea. Financially, there's the additional military expenditure and enormous expense of building several islands, never mind the environmental damage. They don't seem to have any significant historical or legal claim (the International Criminal Court has ruled against them). Plus the significant downside of the constant risk of conflict that expansion generates.

I decide to write this piece because there is a lot of misperception and clichés about Indonesia in the media and even many think tanks. Often people remark that the country isn't cohesive and will balkanize. Many Australian observers have been saying this since the 1950s.  This post will explain **geographical and historical coherence of Indonesia.**

First, Indonesia must be understood as a West-East Thalassocracy orientated around trade much like civilizations in Mediterranean. The trading concern transitioned into a plantation economy, and from this arose the plantation-settler state.  The Indonesia's geostrategic drive even before it became independent was furthering the territorial expansion and exploitation (ie furthering the plantation system). Indonesia's foreign policy throughout much of its history involved advancing this form of nation building -- securing Indonesia's independence, recognition for Indonesia's ""territorial expansion / consolidation""

# INDONESIA'S GEOSTRATEGIC DOCUMENT

Indonesia's geostrategic document is Wawasan Nusantara or ARCHIPELAGIC OUTLOOK. It states Indonesia's geography. the Indonesia's geographical challenges, and how to deal with them. Wawasan Nusantara is based on the Djuanda Declaration which recognized:

* Indonesia is an archipelagic state made up thousands of islands
* All the islands and the seas connecting these Island fall under Indonesia's national territory
* Free peaceful navigation by foreign ships through these waters will be guaranteed, as long as they don't disrupt Indonesia's sovereignty.

The declaration was made formalized into law in 1960, and serves as the basis for Indonesia's archipelagic state concept submitted to the UN.

Over time, four main themes emerged out of this conception[(1) an enduring concern over geographical location; (2) a suspicion toward extra-regional powers; (3) an aspiration for regional activism and leadership; and (4) a concern over national unity in the wake of fragmented geography](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e3c9e1d1758e2877e03ba5/t/5b413e7d70a6ad05d0588d10/1531002494491/JIOR+-+Indonesia+Geopolitical+Architecture.pdf).

# INDONESIAN GEOGRAPHY

Indonesia rest between Pacific and Indian Ocean, and between the Asian and Australian continents. As shown on the map there are four access points from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean that across Indonesia - Malacca Strait, Sunda Strait (ALKI I), Celebes-Lombok Strait (AKLIII), Banda Sea (ALKI--III)

According to a Rand Report published in 2013 [Employing Land-Based Anti-Ship Missiles in the Western Pacific](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/TR1300/TR1321/RAND_TR1321.pdf)

>Both Indonesia and Malaysia have robust arsenals of medium-range ASMs that, if these countries were willing, could effectively engage targets anywhere along the strait’s approximately 730-km length... would be difficult to defeat without employing land forces to locate these missile systems, which are mobile and relatively small in size ... Ships coming from the Indian Ocean could simply use the next-closest waterways, the Sunda and Lombok straits. However, the narrowness of these passages means that they could be easily covered with short-range missiles as well

The archipelago of 18,108 islands comprises 2.8 km2 (92,877 sq. km of inland waters), 1,826,440 km2 of land, and if the EEZ is factored in, the country’s area stretches to 7.9 million km2. Below is a map of Indonesia super imposed on Europe.

However. despite the vast expense, East-West orientation means its aligned with the trade winds, which provide conduit for trade and migration much like the Mediterranean

# AUSTRONESIAN THALASSOCRACY

All the large states in Maritime Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia) are Austronesian Thalassocracies.

Roughly 97% of Indonesians are Austronesian/Part Austronesian. Indonesian as well as 400 other  Austronesian languages are spoken as the native tongue by 98% of Indonesians..   Indonesia is the world's largest Austronesian country.  Below are a maps of ethnic and religious distribution   However, the map only shows the geographical spread based of their region of origin.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vamuuhfumzv51.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=4070e4678f9af6bed60eef41e6b84d5ed330f876

The first reason why I introduce Indonesia as an Austronesian entity, because there Austronesians  elements in Indonesia's national symbols.

Secondly, it helps to understand Maritime Southeast Asia.  The basic cultural identity of Maritime Southeast Asia is Austronesian. The salim gesture is found across the region, whether in the [Philippine](https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/philippines-faith-and-family-hand-hand-divorce-illegal)s (referred to as Mano in the Philippines), Malaysia and in Indonesia from a [governor](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/01/11/jokowi-moves-closer-pdi-p-s-megawati.html),[jungle nomads in Sumatra](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/01/11/jokowi-moves-closer-pdi-p-s-megawati.html) to Papuans living in coastal areas.. [The non-Austronesian influences like Hindu-Buddhist, Muslim or Christian are layers of culture on top of the Austronesian core](https://press.anu.edu.au/publications/series/comparative-austronesian/austronesians).

Lastly,  Austronesian culture influences settlement and ultimately Indonesian geopolitics.   According to Eurasianist Petr Savitsky, a civilization or group of people, have a specific [mestorazvitie](https://books.google.ca/books?id=uskPRW0XLwYC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=mestorazvitie&source=bl&ots=sMjRu-YtOj&sig=ACfU3U3yJCEu4Ob6JWVoJeuYwoQYY3keNg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjn3_DCjsLrAhVMqZ4KHS68DmsQ6AEwAHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=mestorazvitie&f=false) or place of development. This is to answer perrendial question whether Indonesia is going to invade Australia. The answer is no For Austronesians their mestorazvitie has been islands, particularly ones with volcanos.  Austronesian civilizations are primarily found on sub-tropical/tropical volcanic islands. 90% of Austronesians live on volcanic islands, the volcanic soils compensate for the lack of large river basins.

**WEST EAST THALASSOCRACY**

Indonesia is the only major Island country aligned longitudinally. The foundation of longitudinal thalassocracies is trade, because of the alignment with East-West trade wins.

In the Mediterranean, Phoenician traders created the network of ports that eventually became the Carthaginian Empire. In the Baltic, it was German traders from Northern Germany travelling and setting up shop in various ports that laid the foundation for Hanseatic League.

&#x200B;

[Hanseatic League](https://preview.redd.it/wenk2633nzv51.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=076ddf07aee56daada9389ced01100272149d767)

In Indonesian archipelago, various migratory trading communities like the Malays in Western Indonesia and Bugis  / Makassarsse in the Eastern Indonesia created a network that the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) grafted onto.

Another similar characteristic was the development of trading lingua franca, during the Iron Age in Mediterranean it was Phoenancian, [Hanseatic League it was Middle Low German](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Middle-Low-German)(MLG) and in the Indonesian archipelago it was Malay.    In Indonesia, the influence of Malay was established even before it was adopted as Indonesia's national language. Malay creoles are spoken as the main language stretch from Jakarta to the [Papuan Bird's Head](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/mapsonline/sites/default/files/styles/cartogis_700x700/public/maps/bitmap/standard/2014/06/00-077_Birds_Head.png?itok=LJgP9Oxy).

# CORE AND PERIPHERY

The main geostrategic dichotomy in Indonesia is the Java (Core) vs outer islands (Periphery), it informs Indonesian debates on development, defense-security, and socio-political.

The island of Java was the population center of Maritime Southeast Asia. In 1800 it had a population greater than the rest of Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines combined. Even today, Java has only 6% of Indonesia land mass, but 57% of its population.

What made Java attractive for human habitation was the highest density of active volcanoes of the major islands in SEA, comparatively few earthquakes since its 500 km away from kilometers from major fault lines. Java resembles the Italian Peninsula in the Mediterranean, another location that benefited from volcanic soils.

https://preview.redd.it/dggh1ib8nzv51.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8839e478e05f3a800c5cd0f996e9b52ba50f4a5f

&#x200B;

A major debate in Indonesian discourse is the developmental inequality between Java )particularly Jakarta) and the rest. There have been accusations of Javanese Imperialism (the dominant ethnic group in Indonesia), that natural resources from the rest of Indonesia support Java. Reality is per capita incomes on Java are the same as the national average.  This perception remains large because Java had a head start on development during the colonial period and it attracts a lot of investment relative to its physical area (50% of Indonesia's foreign investment ends up on Java)

From a defense viewpoint, the hard core and hallow periphery has been a characteristic vulnerability.

The Mongols in 1292 and Japanese in 1942 sailed right into Java with little resistance in the outer islands.

[Japanese Invasion Route](https://preview.redd.it/6608od1cnzv51.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31f9a6418958422abc2f0d6b5ca4962196f29ff)

The Java vs Outer island divide also translate into political differences. The Javanese (96% of who are Muslim)( vote for left wing secular / moderate Islamic parties / candidates, while non-Javanese Muslims vote for more right wing secular / hardline Islamic parties / candidates.

# MATARAM SULTANATE AND THE DUTCH-INDONESIAN CONTINUAM

The foundation of the Indonesian state starts with the reign of Hanyakrakusuma (Sultan Agung) the third ruler of the Mataram Sultanate,1613-1645,

During his reign he expanded the Sultanate from Central Java to cover almost all of Java. Prior to his reign, kingdom in Indonesia were sea based trading kingdoms, with direct control over small pockets of land. It postulated that Sultan Agung  believed you needed to conquer Java first, before conquering the rest of the archipelago. The Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit tried to do this, without bringing Western Java under their control.

Sultan Agung introduced a centralized administration to manage conquered territory, in contrast to the vassal system of a [Mandala polity used before](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.14318/hau3.3.033) . He assigned adipati (Dukes) to rule provinces called kadipaten. In the past defeated enemies often continued to rule their fiefdom as vassals of the conquering kingdom; under Sultan Agung they were held as ""prisoners"" in the capital.  As a result of the centralization and treatment of defeated enemies, the reign of Sultan's Agung and his successors was one of war. and rebellion

When the VOC took over Mataram territories in the mid-1700s, they kept this structure while only changing terminology. [Adipati became Bupati (Regent or Regenten ) and kadipaten became Kebupaten (Regency or Regentschappen)..](https://books.google.ca/books?id=yVVUAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA205&lpg=PA205&dq=mataram+sultanate+modern+indonesia+bupati&source=bl&ots=gpoMellbqZ&sig=ACfU3U0PwdndH4l03xo39Y9XUk9QrWKX0Q&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=mataram%20sultanate%20modern%20indonesia%20bupati&f=false) Indonesia still uses this structure, but with the province replacing the residency.

Until its bankruptcy  in 1796, the VOC remained primarily a maritime trading concern, However, the plantations it setup in West Java in early 1700s, became the economic justification for territorial expansion and conquest  that continued into late 20th century.

https://preview.redd.it/b32dygzdnzv51.png?width=443&format=png&auto=webp&s=c73dd20b91310922f178c67a962653d8a00c9ec9

What made this expansion possible was the [Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/5005d886-9c27-421e-a22d-44fb5965350c), which resolved the long standing disputes between the Dutch and British, and set clear sphere of influence. It divided the Malacca Strait down the middle and established the borders of British Malaya and Dutch East Indies, and by extension modern day Malaysia and Indonesia.

# THE PLANTATION-SETTLER STATE

Indonesia is a plantation-settler state, with the [plantation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4375993?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A53ea63ef32f88054d8f0f0b6b8391aa5&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents) and [settler ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4375993?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A53ea63ef32f88054d8f0f0b6b8391aa5&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents)aspects separating and merging throughout history

**PLANTATIONS**

The first Dutch [plantations were built in West Java in the late 18th century](https://books.google.ca/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&pg=PA360&lpg=PA360&dq=dutch+plantations+west+java+coffee+first&source=bl&ots=3YxVGd86ZT&sig=ACfU3U0cYi10Eej1WpuIvnlPlY6_8mqWGg&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=dutch%20plantations%20west%20java%20coffee%20first&f=false)

However, in 1800, much of Java was still jungle, but within a century Java was viewed by many as the world's [most modern plantation economy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/itinerario/article/turning-javanese-the-domination-of-cubas-sugar-industry-by-java-cane-varieties/D8730E33D66A14B8E6A81E426045CCBF). New lands were opened up, and peasants were forced to grow cash crops. Farmers allocated converted irrigated rice fields for cash crops, and marginal lands was used to grow corn, cassava and sweet potato. As a result Java was plagued by famines until the 1970s, when Suharto transitioned irrigated lands back to growing rice,

By the mid-19th century, the Dutch had opened up coffee and rubber plantations in Sumatra, and by 1880s they begin to import Javanese coolies.

From [1900-1960, plantation crops made up about 50-60% of Dutch East Indies/Indonesia exports](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4375993?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A53ea63ef32f88054d8f0f0b6b8391aa5&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents). While Java transitioned away from plantation economy in the 1970s, the economies of the outer islands are still plantation economies. Palm Oil and other cash crops still make up 30% of Indonesia's exports.

**SETTLERS**

However, Indonesia's was the most extensive, [20 Million people and their descendants are products of the transmigration program](https://www.voaindonesia.com/a/transmigrasi-program-yang-mengubah-wajah-indonesia/4568597.html).

There are four commonly cited reasons for the resettlement:

* Reduce the strain on Java, which has 6% of Indonesia's land, but contains 57% of the population.
* [Open up unused land, and to distribute development to the sparsely populated outer island](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4375993?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A53ea63ef32f88054d8f0f0b6b8391aa5&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents)s

The first transmigration settlement was established in [Lampung on the Southern tip of Sumatra in 1905](https://ditjenpkp2trans.kemendesa.go.id/resources/files/a2e27404a080382134857e7ef4874c6f.pdf). From 1949-67, about 578,000 transmigrants were sent.

**TRANSMIGRATION SETTLEMENTS UNDER SUHARTO 1967-2000**

Under Suharto from 1967-2000, Indonesia sent over 5.5 Million transmigrants, and during the peak from[ 1979-1984, they sent 2.4 Million](https://books.google.ca/books?id=0CbfDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=transmigration+suharto+numbers&source=bl&ots=oGGKXls3T8&sig=ACfU3U0UK2rDzqdV9jUyU1ftEVcICodfPA&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=transmigration%20suharto%20numbers&f=false). The majority were landless agricultural workers, Here is a map of all the transmigrant areas since 1905.

There were [four categories of transmigrants](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4375993?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A53ea63ef32f88054d8f0f0b6b8391aa5&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents). Transmigrants who migrated from another region (usually Java and Bali), those who moved from one settlement to another, those who [were moved because of natural disasters](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3773777?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) and spontaneous migrants who funded their own expenses for the move.

Transmigrants were from one region (ie Java or Bali), but not from one particular village. In this period they usually settled non-Muslims in non-Muslim areas, largely to avoid conflicts over raising pigs.

Settlement were usually built away from the local villages/towns to avoid conflict. While in colonial and Sukarno era settlements transmigrants cleared the land, by 1970s infrastructure, housing and support facilities built before transmigrants arrived. [The cost in 1977 to move a family of five was US$1200 and by the early 1990s it increased to US$4200](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4375993?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A53ea63ef32f88054d8f0f0b6b8391aa5&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents) The cost[ included transport, land, housing materials, tools, seeds and initial food suppli](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4375993?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A53ea63ef32f88054d8f0f0b6b8391aa5&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents)es. This is a significant sum given the country's per capita income was only US$500 in 1990. Indonesia funded this from government revenue and [loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/187401468042260249/pdf/28489.pdf))

**ISSUES WITH THE PLANTATION-SETTLER STATE**

Indonesia's plantations and settlements have been associated with Land Disputes and Environmental Destruction, Patronage and Corruption and Ethnic and Religious Conflict.

**Land Disputes and Environmental Destruction**

Most of the land disputes involving local inhabitants were with plantations and spontaneous migrants, [Konsorsium Pembaruan Agraria](https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/09/23/when-we-lost-forest-we-lost-everything/oil-palm-plantations-and-rights-violations) (Consortium for Agrarian Reform, KPA), an Indonesian NGO, documented more than 650 land-related conflicts affecting over 650,000 households in 2017 ( [502,000 Ha](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/01/04/plantations-engulfed-land-disputes.html) ).

Indonesia has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, with more than 74 million hectares (285,700 square miles) of rainforest,[ an area nearly twice the size of Japan - logged, burned or degraded in the last half century, according to Greenpeace](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/08/indonesia-president-makes-moratorium-on-forest-clearance-permanent/).

**Corruption and Patronage**

The opening of new lands is a corrupt process even by Indonesian standards. Embezzlement is higher because new infrastructure is being built and due to distance from Jakarta.

The second type of corruption is the payment of bribes for permits, licenses and titles. Here is a list of recent cases

* [Indonesian officials charged in $1.6m bribes-for-permits scheme](https://news.mongabay.com/2019/12/indonesia-palm-oil-permits-bribes-corruption-kpk/)
* [Palm Oil Sustainability Certifier to Review Indonesian Bribery Claims](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palm-oil-sustainability-certifier-to-review-indonesian-bribery-claims-11584752501)
* [Major palm oil company execs arrested for bribery in Indonesia](https://medium.com/@foe_us/major-palm-oil-company-execs-arrested-for-bribery-in-indonesia-a5a726d6c231)

Lastly, both the Indonesian Military (particularly the Army) and Police were and are still involved in illicit activity, like smuggling, drug trafficking, [protection rackets](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/11/is-a-us-mining-company-funding-a-violent-crackdown-in-indonesia/249164/) and [illegal logging](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/indonesian-military-deeply-involved-in-logging).

In respect, to the military, this participation is an offshoot of operating legitimate businesses from [1945-2010, and has been effectively phased out](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/05/23/indonesian-militarys-role-economy-set-be-phased-out.html), The military involvement in business arose during the War of Independence 1945-49. when it had raise money to support themselves. [In 2009, it was estimated the INdonesian military businesses had about US$350 Million in assets, and generated a profit of US$ 29.5 Million / year.](https://books.google.ca/books?id=8Nw6hCPZWAEC&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=Indonesia+TNI+logging+corruption&source=bl&ots=iQe2wEFonG&sig=ACfU3U3uVNGvTQ1eThrsoPVs7lrqxs0TpQ&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Indonesia%20TNI%20logging%20corruption&f=false). [Because these enterprises no longer exist and also due to rise in retirement age, the Indonesian Army has hundreds of colonels and general with no functional position.](https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/indonesia-s-jobs-for-generals-plan-alarms-rights-groups-1.567827)

**ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS TENSION**

Given the scale of the program, the consensus among scholars is there has been relatively little ethnic and religious conflicts between transmigrants and local inhabitants,. Most of the violent incidents had occurred in Sukarno era projects where they put non-Muslim migrants in Muslim areas and vice versa like with [Balinese Hindu migrants and Lampung natives](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-20139474) in Sumatra (2012). Post-Sukarno era projects avoided this by trying to settle non-Muslim settlers in non-Muslim areas.

# THE HARDWARE OF THE PLANTATION-SETTLER STATE

In this discussion, I will talk about physical infrastructure, and the government instruments used to secure control -- civilian bureaucracy and the military.

**INFRASTRUCTURE**

From the late 18th century until recently, the transportation network (roads, railways and ports) and irrigation systems were prioritized. The transportation networks were designed to transport crops(and later on natural resources from plantations and mines to nearby ports for export markets. At the moment only Java has a islandwide rail system and expressway. In all the other major islands, there is no expressway, just a series of roads connecting to each other, which may or may not form an island wide system.

Export manufacturing industries setup starting from the 1980s followed a similar pattern.  Most export industries, like in the rest of Southeast Asia, are house in industrial estates

The focus of Power generation is to supply industry and industrial estates. As a result of this focus on industrial power generation, as recently as [2004 electrification was only 50%](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/182314/achieving-electricity-access-ino.pdf) (now its 99.8%)

As a result of this estate focus, nationwide connectivity is still poor. Logistics[ sectors is plagued by long delivery times and unreliability.](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/617051540584814484/pdf/WP-PUBLIC-2015-WBG-Improving-Freight-Logistics.pdf)

After *Reformasi*, infrastructure spending dropped from 9% of GDP in the mid-1990s to 3.6% in 2014. [However,](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/indonesia-economy-targets-up-to-6-percent-gdp-growth-5-years-11750214) as a result of big infrastructure push under the current President, Joko Widodo, [as of 2019 its 6% of GDP](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/indonesia-economy-targets-up-to-6-percent-gdp-growth-5-years-11750214).  Since 2014, the focus has been to address issues of distribution and connectivity.  Long delayed infrastructure projects like Trans Java expressway, Trans Papuan Road Network and Jakarta MRT have been completed

**CIVILIAN BUREAUCRACY**

From the colonial era to 2003, the Indonesian state was centralized, the regional governments, [provincial and district (regency) only controlled 14% of government](http://www.anggaran.kemenkeu.go.id/api/Medias/1e01d82c-861a-47fe-8ccc-f0999e7687b9) expenditure. The center controlled nearly all capital expenditure. and executed programs based on centralized five year plans

The centralized bureaucracy was necessary to  settle large numbers of people from one part of the country to another, because you have end to end control. In Indonesia, transmigration was handled and coordinated by Department of Transmigration.

After 1998, the Indonesian government implemented a big decentralizing push. The centralized Five Year Plans were scrapped, budgets, some revenue collecting authority, personal and assets were devolved to regional governments. 60% of central government bureaucracy had been transferred to regional governments (2.1 Million people)

**MILITARY**

At the core of Indonesia's military doctrine is [Abdul Haris Nasution’s Fundamentals of Guerrilla Warfare](https://ivorytowerscribbles.blog/2016/10/11/le-notes-15-the-indonesian-way-of-guerrilla-warfare/#:~:text=To%20summarise%2C%20Nasution%20provides%20the,develop%20from%20weak%20to%20strong) (1953) who served as Army Chief of Staff from 1949-52 and 1955-66. Nasution, having fought on both sides, saw insurgency and counter insurgency as two sides of the same coin. Secondly, given the weakness of Indonesia navy and airforce, the external defense of Indonesia would be organized as a people's guerilla war with the military taking the lead role.

In addition, Nasution was a key proponent in the [Indonesia's Army adoption of the Prussian Wehrkreis (military district) as a method of territorial defense and troop mobilization](https://books.google.com/books?id=j6RBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=indonesian+army+military+district+german&source=bl&ots=1VWDA8R-07&sig=ACfU3U3bgddIy_QOnDV-NGHLzgnfV9jeqg&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=indonesian%20army%20military%20district%20german&f=false). The Indonesian Army has 15 KODAM (*Komando Daerah Militer or Regional Military Commands)* Each Kodam is divided smaller territorial units, with the smallest being village level command (BABINSA). At the center there is the Strategic Reserves (KOSTRAD) and the Special Forces (KOPASSUS)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pi10v35vnzv51.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=6eecbeac8d7078212c3abaf75be93b162088d4a2

There are three extra Kodam formed since the map was produced, Kodam Trikora has split into Kasuari and Cenderawasih, Kodam Wirabuana split into Hasanuddin and Merdeka.

[Nasution also came up with the Military's dual function (Dwifungsi) role in 1955, which the government implemented in 1966](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24490795?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A66d311a0ebba28ea14ec60cfb1f00586&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). It stipulated beside the military's defense functions, the military should participate in every effort and activity of the people in the field of ideology, politics and economics. The military was given reserved seats in Parliament, as well as important positions in the civilian bureaucracy, state owned companies and regional government (city mayors and provincial governors).

The democratic transition had a major impact on the military in three ways. First the military no longer adheres to dwifungsi role. Reserved seats in parliament have been eliminated, and no longer parachuted into civilian positions like mayor. Secondly, the focus of the Indonesian military is now external defense. Thirdly, the budgets of the Navy and Airforce has been increased. Fourthly, the Armed Forces Chief of Staff is rotated between three branches, before it was held by an army generals. Since 2019, [the Indonesian military has been organized on a joint command system Kogabwilhan (Komando Gabungan Wilayah Pertahanan) with a Western, Central and Eastern Joint Command](https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4723928/panglima-tni-resmikan-dan-lantik-3-kogabwilhan).

**As 65 year old Putin goes on his last period as President he enacts the unpopular but necessary reforms, taking the heat for his successor.**

It did not take long for the lights to go out on Luzhniski Stadium before the protest started against the Russian President. The second honeymoon period after the Crimea invasion and 80+ pct approval rate is over, now the next years will be though and painful as Russia adopts to the new demographic, aging population and new world order.

The economic situation in Russia has put pressure on Putin. He drives Russia like a hybrid between electoral democracy and a feudalism where the nobility is however who is in Putin nearest circle, all supported by the clergy of public sector, security services and other bureaucrats.

Now this sector is the one that Putin really needs the support of, and he has it as long as the sector gets better than average pensions, salaries and gets a free pass for the many small bribes that they receive. The economic sanctions has made sure that these benefits are smaller and less regular than in the golden period of 2002-2010 of Russian economy, and that hurts Putin on a personal level.

The two [recent](https://echo.msk.ru/blog/planperemen/2235330-echo/) regulations to stop the negative economic trend shows a regime where the man on the top is preparing to make thing easier for their successor.

**VAT and Pensions**

The first announcement of the pension age came very fast in the first celebrations of the victory against Egypt, with reactions just as expected. Demonstrations and fall in Putins [approval](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/07/19/vladimir-putins-approval-ratings-are-dropping-this-is-why/?utm%5C_term=.2954887eaf6d).

From 62 pct in June to 49 pct just a month later. For people that follow U.S politics know that the 50 pct threshold is the magic number. 49 pct approval in a country where Putin has control off Media, security and finances is worrying for many people in Moscow. Especially in a time where Russia just concluded a successful World Cup. Similar polls show equally drop in faith when it comes to Russia economical future.

Now, the increase in pension from 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 63 for women is alienating but necessary in a country where average lifespan has gone up 6 yrs since 2013. (Females would have in average 22 yrs as pensioners without the increase),

However the VAT increase also recently [announced](https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-signs-measure-to-raise-russia-s-vat/29412635.html) shows that its not just a needed calibration of the social structure but a desperate measure to stop the economic stagnation of the country. While it can be defended that the retirement needed to change, the VAT increase could be seen as a unnecessary confrontation with the Russian people.

VAT hurts everyone, and its spread equally to all of the segments of the supporters of Putin, the middle class, the poor and not at least the public sector that is the fundament of Putin support.

**Sanctions hurts**

This two actions combined with a recently signed a package of law that allows Russia-controlled foreign offshore companies to be re-registered in offshore financial centers, established in Russia\\\&#39;s Kaliningrad Region and Primorsky Territory in order to minimize the possible consequences of sanctions and political risks from foreign countries, show that the sanctions are hurting Russia more than they will admit.

The real pressure for Putin is when his inner circle of oligarchs gets less spoil to share among them. After being cut of from lucrative contracts in the western world, Putin appeased them by giving their companies mega-contracts in Russia. The Kerch bridge and the different stadiums for the World cup just to mention a few. The money for these projects has now dried up and there is no more room for financial corruption to be spent.

People who have studied Putin has stated that the Russian president biggest fear is to be dragged out of the Kremlin by the Russian people, not a unprecedented fear considering the story of the country. When it is less money to go around, people use violence to get their share and no one is more proned for fight than the higher hierachy of russian power. Maria Snegovaya [writes](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/644196%5C_cd984c793c1642b2b7f5ff21ac4e4af5.pdf) that evidence suggests that economic sanctions are fostering a divide between (1) the groups that profit from Western money (Russia’s “oligarchs”), and (2) those who wield state power and/or profit from the domestic budget. (Russia’s siloviki).

For those who has read Russian history knows the consequence that will come of a clash between these two powers.

Since at least the nineteenth century with the rise of mass politics and modernity various forms of ideologies have been dominating public discourse and vying for control.

Liberalism has been the dominant in the recent era in it's various forms across much of the Americas, Europe, Japan, India, turkey among others while various forms authoritarian states without any very clear ideology is in power in places like Russia,Egypt and Pakistan. Iran is run by a theocratic ideology while China and some other states like North Korea and Cuba officially profess communism but only in name.

Both radical alternatives to liberalism, fascism and communism crumbled in 1945 and 1989 and now only have niche supports. But now liberalism or neoliberalism itself seems to be falling across the world which makes me think that we are about to see the emergence of new ideologies that will vie for power like happened in the last century so the question is then what will these be or what will these be *like*?

Pan-humanist egalitarianism aiming for a global state?

Radical environmentalism devoting all to repairing and conserving the environment?

Theocratic movements based around the large religions like islamism and Christian Dominionism/integralism? Iran is a sort of example in this.

A resurgences of socialism and communism?

A resurgence of fascism?

A race based civilizationism based around Samuel Huntington's work?

Old style ethnic nationalism?

Eco-socialism and Eco-fascism?

Or ideology less oligarchicalism?"

"The missing context of ""how financially important is Hong Kong to China?""",468,0.95,e3az9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/e3az9l/the_missing_context_of_how_financially_important/,90,2019-11-29,"Over the last few months, in threads covering the HK issue in this sub and others, individuals have debated over how ""important"" Hong Kong is to China, usually in terms of how much China depends on Hong Kong for its economic prosperity. Individuals on one side of the argument point out the degree to which China depends on HK as a point for Chinese money and companies to transfer through and interact with the rest of the world -- while individuals on the other side of the argument have suggested HK is much smaller in size relative to China now than 20 years ago or that China has potential alternatives to HK that can be developed as financial centres.

I think the various comments I've seen on both sides of this argument -- with the caveat that I obviously haven't read every comment about this matter -- seem to overlook one rather important contextual point, which is that HK's financial or economic importance to China is *relative* to HK's historical and cultural importance to China.

What I mean by this of course, is that HK is arguably the first significant ""loss"" of territory and part of the first ""process"" (i.e.: the Opium War and the treaty/ies which followed) that China experienced of the ""century of humiliation"" whereby China experienced significant losses of sovereignty, territory, wealth and security, causing significant cultural and historical trauma. (I wrote an [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/dup6s8/why_is_the_century_of_humiliation_such_a_huge/f77mod6/?context=3) to a question asked by someone a while back about the importance of the ""century of humiliation"", which may be relevant here)

By now I think most people talking about the HK issue today are least superficially familiar with the political process that led up to the handover of HK from the UK to China, and roughly aware of the terms which were tenuously agreed upon between China and the UK at the time. Most of the major focus in recent years has been the degree of autonomy HK experiences, and the issue of ""universal suffrage"". But I believe the cultural and historical motivations on which China sought to ""return"" HK to China in the 20th century (and which culminated in the 1997 handover), was very much a desire to seek ""closure"" or ""catharsis"" for what was perceived as one of the first and most symbolic unjust ""losses"" of the tumultuous and damaging 19th-20th century period. From the Chinese side, I believe that giving HK 50 years of autonomy from 1997 to 2047, was made with the ultimate goal (either in 2047 specifically, or beyond) of reintegrating HK into China proper and to erase the effects of the Opium War and to ""close the chapter"" from associated losses of that initial ""first injustice"" of the century of humiliation. This isn't to say that HK doesn't have any physical/territorial or economic value, but I do think the biggest reason why China is committed to HK is because of the historical and cultural grievance.

With the above context in mind, I believe that the question of ""how financially important is Hong Kong to China"" should really be expanded as ""*how financially important is Hong Kong to China, given Hong Kong's territorial/sovereignty status is likely perceived by China as a historical grievance and a product of unjust foreign aggression that needs reintegration to attain closure*"".

That extra context is lengthy, but IMO it is essential if one wants to discuss the way in which China may manage the HK situation. So, if one wants to consider how China may respond to recent US legislative pressure or other potential foreign pressure applied on HK's financial status, I think it's vital to look at how that pressure is weighed up against China's longer term goal of reintegrating HK into China proper and seeking closure of HK as a historical grievance.

&#x200B;

====

I also note that some people have suggested the reason China hasn't intervened with its military or paramilitary forces in HK is because of the foreign pressure that will be applied on HK as a financial conduit for China.

1. I think some people overestimate China's ""trigger-happy-ness,"" with at least some of those impressions being based on what they think China's response to the Tiananmen protests in 1989 was like.
2. Greatly underestimating the threshold with which China perceives events in HK as requiring physical, official mainland intervention would be.
3. Finally, China should understand by now, that the strategy and goal of the black shirts is to use escalating marginal violence to provoke an ""excessive"" Chinese response to try to exact larger scale foreign pressure against China proper, which China likely sees as not worth the little benefit that direct intervention could bring at this stage."
Why is the US fiercely pro-Israel?,471,0.96,by1kla,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/by1kla/why_is_the_us_fiercely_proisrael/,290,2019-6-8,"I know my question is controversial but I'm not talking about lobbying or any conspiracy theories of how American politicians like money and Israel has it. What I mean is, geopolitically how is it useful to support Israel? Like recognizing Jerusalem or the Golan Heights as Israeli land and letting Israel expand into the West Bank and build settlements?

I'd understand if Israel was a NATO member and provided the US with military bases and soldiers for its campaigns like in Afghanistan or Iraq but none of those things happen. So it feels like the US doesn't gain anything geopolitically, if anything it loses since it angers all the other Arab countries. 

The other point is that Israel is democratic, but so was Apartheid South Africa and according to most historians the US abandoned South Africa easily outside of some diplomatic support in Angola. 

Wouldn't it have made sense for the US to have reached out to the Arabs and tried to bring back the Baghdad Pact (the Muslim NATO formed by the US)?"

North Korea should have a medium level of human development at 0.766 or 0.733 (on par with Latin American countries). If you actually calculate the HDI of North Korea though given life expectancy and GDP per capita you get a much lower number: 0.583 which is below many African countries.

&#x200B;

If you google search pictures of North Korea,[it seems quite developed and urbanized.](https://nautilus.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nk006_resize-639x355.jpg) But then again if you google search the capitals of [poor African countries](https://cdn.britannica.com/10/210210-050-A31F0882/Monrovia-Liberia.jpg) you get the same results.

&#x200B;

My question is what effect are continuous sanctions having on North Korea's socioeconomic development? And how is North Korea maintaining its military if its budget is dwarfed by many African nations? Does North Korea have a shadow economy fueled by slave labor perhaps? Or are there hidden factors that some of the few published numbers of North Korea do not reveal?"

"""Saudi Arabia stops funding foreign mosques"": primary source?",462,0.98,evi4rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/evi4rn/saudi_arabia_stops_funding_foreign_mosques/,32,2020-1-29,"The entire /r/geopolitics community was quite happy to hear the news story of [Saudi Arabia deciding to stop funding foreign mosques to spread their Wahhabi agenda](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/eur0br/saudi_arabia_to_stop_funding_mosques_in_foreign/). 

However, the [article](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200125-saudi-arabia-to-stop-funding-mosques-in-foreign-countries/) by the *Middle East Monitor* does not contain any relevant quote by the former Saudi minister of justice, Mohammed Bin Abdul-Karim Issa. The following is his quote cited in the article.

>""The time has come to hand over the Geneva Mosque to a Swiss administrative council that represents Muslims in the area. It should have an elected cleric.""

From this quote alone there is nothing to suggest that the Saudi government has decided to stop nor prevent the funding of the mosque on a worldwide scale.

The only excerpt that suggests the headline is this part: 

>Former Saudi minister of justice, Mohammed Bin Abdul-Karim Issa, has announced that his country will stop funding mosques in foreign countries, Arabi21.com reported on Friday.

So I decided to check what did [the article on *Arabi21*](https://arabi21.com/story/1239679/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A4%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D9%86%D9%88%D9%82%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC) says. *Arabi21* seems to be a relatively new Arabic media founded in 2013 and claims to be independent, and I am not sure where are they based. 

I can read very basic media-level Arabic. These are the relevant parts (apologies for the broken format, I dunno how to fix):

>ونقلت صحيفة ""Le Matin Dimanche"" السويسرية عن العيسى قوله: ""سنتوقف عن تمويل دور العبادة في الدول الأجنبية"".

>وبيّن أن السعودية ""ستتخذ الإجراءات ذاتها في جميع أنحاء العالم. في كل مكان، ستؤسس مجالس إدارية محلية بالتعاون مع السلطات الوطنية، وتحديدا لأسباب أمنية. لا بد أن نضمن بالتأكيد أن المساجد في أيد أمينة، ثم لن نتدخل بعدها"".

which translate to: 

>""We will stop financing the places of worship in foreign countries,"" Al-Issa was quoted by Swiss newspaper Le Matin Dimanche as saying.

>And he explained that Saudi Arabia ""will take the same measures all over the world. Everywhere, it will establish local administrative councils in cooperation with the national authorities, specifically for security reasons. We must certainly ensure that the mosques are in safe hands, and then we will not interfere after them.""

So the original source now seems to be *Le Matin Dimanche*. This is a Swiss-based newspaper founded in 1972, and considered a tabloid media. 

Although I cannot speak French, I tried my best to find a relevant article, which I believe [this one](https://www.lematin.ch/suisse/mosquee-remise-musulmans-suisse/story/28090213). 

Upon using google translate, I couldn't find any actual quote by Issa that directly states what was written on the *Arabi21* article. One of the direct quotes by Issa in the article is the following, which talks in the specific context of a mosque in Geneva.

>«Il est temps de confier la mosquée de Genève à un conseil d'administration suisse, représentatif, avec un président élu»

So now I am lost. Can anyone else find the original quote by Issa that directly states that the Saudi government will now stop or systematically prevent the funding of the foreign mosques?"

Some examples of this: 

[House Passes Uighur Human Rights Bill, Prodding Trump to Punish China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/us/politics/house-uighurs-china-sanctions.html)

[UK, US, Australia and Canada scold China over Hong Kong law](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-britain-idUSKBN23425F)

[US Pledges Support to Taiwan, Amid Deepening China Tensions](https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/us-pledges-support-taiwan-amid-deepening-china-tensions)

China has so far lacked the soft power or the political will to retaliate in any meaningful way on this front but with their investments in American media companies and data collection abilities from various successful tech conglomerates they are poised to change that. 

Also the recent willingness of Chinese diplomats and civil servants to retaliate against “deliberate insults” by the west has seen the rise of figures like [Zhao Lijian](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/asia/china-wolf-warrior-diplomacy-intl-hnk/index.html) in the CCP. A counselor at the Chinese embassy in Pakistan, Lijian was promoted as the Deputy Director of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department after his outspoken criticism of America’s various societal issues like racism, income inequality, and rampant gun violence. Since him many other party members of the CCP have taken on a more confrontational tone vis-a-vis the west, a phenomenon that has been colloquially termed *wolf diplomacy* in both American and Chinese media circles. 

With racial tensions reaching a zenith and riots ensuing in the state of Minnesota, along with other smaller protests in various states across the US, is there potential for the Chinese government to capitalize on the discontent and develop the capability to influence events inside the United States?"

There have been many articles talking about the rift between NBA and China. While, some might not consider this a worthy topic for this sub, but I think its very important, because of the following reasons

* Generated considerable media attention in both US and China
* Shows Chinese influence in corporate America
* A sign of deepening ideological rift between America and China

The article I will be looking at is from Sinocism  [**The NBA's poisoned China chalice**](https://sinocism.com/p/the-nbas-poisoned-china-chalice)

Now there are a lot of people who might not like me writing about this, as they didn't like the previous post  [Overview of China Influence and Interference Activities in Australia](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ddbfg7/overview_of_china_influence_and_interference/)

There was a post the other day titled [What is the maximum pressure the US can put on China short of war?](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/dep6y9/what_is_the_maximum_pressure_the_us_can_put_on/) And some one wrote the following

>China understand this well, so it intentionally avoid escalate the  current struggle into ideological fight, which would cause a new cold  war. that's why it never put huge effort like RT of Russia. CGTN rarely  trash USA, most of the time it only promotes domestic development.

Is it really non-ideological? According to George Kennan's Long Telegram  which he sent as Charge d'Affair at American embassy in Moscow in 1946, the Soviet Union posed a threat to liberal democracy at Home (ie the US). This Long Telegram served as a basis for the US Containment policy of the Soviet Union.

>In summary, we have here a political force committed fanatically to the belief that with US there can be no permanent modus vivendi that it is desirable and necessary that the internal harmony of our society be disrupted, our traditional way of life be destroyed,

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union couldn't get an institution anywhere as influential as  the NBA to force an American to censor what he said so openly and blatantly, like how China pressured the NBA with regards to  Daryl Morey  Had this happened in the 1960s, the NBA would be investigated under [Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act) , and people would have been sent to jail.

There are many who consider this isn't geopolitics, it is OK with me. The Cold War was motivated by fear, and right now China is generating fear and anger in the US public This sort of incident will only stiffen the resolve of the China hawks in the US. The China doves will have even more difficult time persuading Congress that China isn't a threat.

# RELEVANT ARTICLES

There have been two recent incidents about Chinese interference in the US or involving US companies - [South Park](https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/10/article/south-park-sends-satirical-rocket-to-china/) and [Blizzard](https://www.vox.com/2019/10/8/20904433/blizzard-hong-kong-hearthstone-blitzchung). I am not going to spend any time discussing these incidents. Here are some relevant and serious articles about the NBA-China incident

[The NBA Is China’s Willing Tool](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/07/us-businesses-like-the-nba-are-chinas-willing-tools/) (Foreign Policy)

[NBA vs. China: The Power Struggle Behind the Standoff](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nba-vs-china-the-power-struggle-behind-the-standoff-11570557671) (Wall Street Journal)

[The Foreign Agents Registration Act Is Broken](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/22/the-foreign-agents-registration-act-is-broken/) (Foreign Policy). FARA is a piece of legislation that was introduced in 1938 to guard against Nazi influence in the US. After the 1966s, it had rarely been used.  [However, the DOJ has brought almsot as many FARA cases in the last 18 months as in the last 40 years](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/fara-law-explained-794340/). FARA as explained in the Foreign Policy article is nasty and far ranging legislation, one does not want to get caught in its cross hairs.

# SUMMARY

The incident started when Daryl Morey, the General Manager of Houston Rockets, a NBA team, wrote the following tweet, "" Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong "" than the commercial gates of hell for both the Rockets and NBA according to Sinocism.

The articles presents John Tsai, the owner of the  Brooklyn Nets  and Executive VP of Alibaba and those of Adam Silver, the NBA Commissioner.. This is what Adam Silver had to say,

>""There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,"" he said.  ""There have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet,  and I have read some of the media suggesting that we are not supporting  Daryl Morey, but in fact we have.""  
>  
>""I think as a values-based  organization that I want to make it clear...that Daryl Morey is  supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of  expression.""..  
>  
>""What I am supporting is his freedom of political expression in this situation,"" he said.  
>  
>""I  am also supporting Joe Tsai. I realize, as I said again, these are  complex issues they don't lend themselves easily to social media. I  can't ultimately run the NBA based on trying to satisfy everyone on  Twitter.""

The article makes the following points, it says the NBA as leverage in China, if it presents a united front. It could backfire, since there is bipartisan outrage in Congress regarding this issue.

In a broader context has long wanted to increase its ""international discourse power  国际话语权“ . It comes into forms 1) On the one hand it is launching, buying, co-opting and coercing  overseas media outlets. 2) On the other it uses the power of the Chinese  market to co-opt and coerce global businesses, their executives and  other elite voices.  This is what the Global Times had to say

>The biggest lesson which can be drawn from the matter is that entities  that value commercial interests must make their members speak  cautiously. Chinese consumers are not overly sensitive. Wherever it is,  touching a raw political nerve is extremely risky. Morey has neither the  IQ nor the EQ to talk about political topics. He will become an example  of clumsiness on some MBA courses.

The writer concludes by taking a quote from [The NBA Is China’s Willing Tool](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/07/us-businesses-like-the-nba-are-chinas-willing-tools/) written by James Palmer

>It will take political power in the United States to [counter political power wielded by China](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/11/if-the-u-s-doesnt-control-corporate-power-china-will/).  For U.S. companies to stop appeasing Chinese censorship, corporate  decision-makers are going to have to believe that the reputational and  political costs of doing so outweigh the damage done to their interests  in China.   But it will also need targeted effort from politicians [who say](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1181030464661999616) they  care. That may mean dragging executives to testify about their  decision, forcing more public embarrassment. It may mean threatening the  government contracts and cozy tax breaks that firms often rely on.

# OPINION

To me its not about whether or not you agree with what Daryl Morey said, but whether the Chinese government can pressure a US organization to censor him. This gets into the area of foreign interference,

Unlike the author I think the NBA Commissioner is more worried about the fallout in the US than China. Professional sports in the US is regulated and depends on governments at various levels from municipal, state and federal. NBA is more susceptible to domestic political pressure than your average US company operating in China. Professional sports leagues in the US is socialist. So China's respond to ban the NBA in its entirety was the correct response from economic perspective, given revenue sharing in the NBA.

The NBA has faced bans in the past in China, the first was during the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Serbia, the second was in 2008 for comments made by some players. However, this time is different, not necessarily because its particularly bad, but because its occurring with the overall context of the Trade War and the current political climate in China.

The reason why I think this incident is different from telling the likes of Marriot not to list Taiwan as a separate country, because China was essentially telling the NBA to censor  Daryl Morey, thus restricting his First Amendment rights, which isn't a crime itself if   the entity pressuring the NBA isn't foreign.  Because a foreign government / entity is pressuring the NBA, this falls under FARA.  The NBA would have to register as a foreign agent."

How could this logically deter the perceived erosion of political rights and freedom (IDK whether it is really the case)?  And what is their best course of action for HKers to actually retain their autonomy? Conversely, what is the CCP's goal in HK? There are serious inflammatory talks about military and rioting, defaming national flags/emblems within the controlled mainland media, which makes me wonder that if they don't want to resort to iron fists, why all this war-drumming?"

We would all assume its an easy question to answer but whilst doing the research for this piece it got vastly more complicated over time, with new alliances popping up Asia and many of India neighbors drifting away from their traditional partners. Most economists are fairly confident that if India was to stick with their current path they will end up in the #2 or #3 slot in the world for GDP, the trouble is though that a number of other nations would suffer from a stronger India, and that is where the root of a lot of future regional tensions may lie.

On our panel this week was

SWAMINATHAN AIYAR >> (CATO Institute)  
DHRUVA JAISHANKAR >> (ORF/Lowy/Brookings)  
HARSH V PANT >> (London School of Economics)

This piece is mostly focused on the Indian perspective, particularly when it comes to issues like Kasmir, The Kashmiri Pandits, and the border disputes with China, so I would love to get the other perspectives as well on this one.   
I think India really does embody the phrase  ""If you understand India, someone's done a bad job explaining it to you."", so Im sure we will come back to India sometime soon.  

This sub was absolutely great for research, so thank you to all of the people here.

I would love your input and feedback as well.

Supreme Ruler Putin? Kremlin non-committal on proposed new job description,422,0.92,evsni2,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/evsni2/supreme_ruler_putin_kremlin_noncommittal_on/,80,2020-1-30,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday that President Vladimir Putin had no view on a proposal that would see his job description change to Supreme Ruler from head of state after a government commission said it was considering the idea.

The title change is one of an array of possible alterations to the Russian constitution put forward by members of a government commission set up after Putin earlier this month said he wanted to change the Russian basic law.

Putin, 67, proposed his own constitutional changes, which were widely seen as giving him scope to retain influence once his current presidential term expires in 2024, though he has said he does not favor the Soviet-era practice of having leaders for life who die in office.
The overhaul, which triggered a change in government, also cemented Putin's control of the transition process and was seen by some as an attempt to reduce intra-clan infighting between now and 2024, while allowing Putin to show he is responding to public discontent after years of belt-tightening.

Have Saudi Arabia and Turkey entered a Cold War of Hegemony?,414,0.97,9ozhcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9ozhcd/have_saudi_arabia_and_turkey_entered_a_cold_war/,74,2018-10-17,"I'm becoming increasingly convinced that much of Saudi Arabia's recent behavior in the Middle East has to do with a Cold War of Hegemony against Turkey.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia's economy has become increasingly fragile due to increased military spending caused by the wars in Syria and Yemen, plus the oil price collapse of 2014-16. In 2015, [the IMF released a report](https://www.worldfinance.com/inward-investment/imf-predicts-saudi-arabia-will-become-bankrupt-shortly) that Saudi Arabia will be bankrupt by the end of the decade unless drastic changes are made to its economic policies, particularly in the realm of debt. And last year, Saudi Deputy Economy Minister Mohamed Al Tuwaijri [made a similar projection](https://financialtribune.com/articles/world-economy/65731/saudi-arabia-under-severe-fiscal-pressures).

Without money, Saudi Arabia's geopolitical position will be weakened in both the Middle East and the rest of the world. And more specifically, its unofficial but widely recognized title as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world will be threatened.

After all, whoever has the gold makes the rules.

Although Iran is a bitter rival to Saudi Arabia, there is no threat of Iran becoming leader of the Sunni world, because Iran is not Sunni. Iran is Shiite. However, there *is* a second country that *does* pose such a threat to Saudi Arabia's leadership role: **Turkey**.

If I accept the premise that Saudi Arabia and Turkey are embroiled in a Cold War of Hegemony over the Sunni world, the following would make a lot more sense, at least to me:

* **The alleged Saudi support/involvement in both the successful coup in Egypt in 2013 and the failed coup attempt in Turkey in 2016.** Some believe that Saudi Arabia was at best supportive and at worst outright involved in both coups. Considering that both coups were targeted at a Sunni head of state supported by Erdogan (in Egypt Mohamed Morsi and in Turkey Erdogan himself), it would absolutely make sense for Saudi Arabia to support them if it wanted to prevent Turkey from posing a threat to its hegemony over the Sunni world.
* **The Qatar Crisis**. Although Saudi Arabia has admitted that Turkey was a factor in its decision to isolate Qatar, it has also tried to portray the Turkish factor as being secondary to other factors, such as Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood and coziness with Iran. I'm not convinced. Turkey's response to the Qatar crisis was significantly harsher than Iran's. Turkey deployed troops to Qatar to protect it from Saudi Arabia, while Iran didn't do anything aside from making condemning public remarks. Based on these reactions, it appears that Turkey may be willing to go to war with Saudi Arabia to protect Qatar, while Iran is not. Meanwhile, Turkey is not in a formal military alliance with Qatar. It has no obligation to protect Qatar. Its decision to deploy troops was made entirely out of its own volition, without any considerations for binding treaties. This type of reaction would only be reasonable if Saudi Arabia was in fact targeting Turkey just as much as it was targeting Iran, if not more so.
* **Prince bin Salman's** **so-called ""reforms.""** When Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced that he was going to reform Saudi Arabia to adopt a more moderate form of Islam and then began to purge the government of so-called ""terrorist sympathizers,"" I was skeptical that he was being truthful about his motivations. Now, I'm almost positive that his purges were entirely related to geopolitics and nothing else. Note that even after the purges: (1) The country has become more authoritarian towards its citizens; (2) Women's rights activists remain jailed even after some of the reforms they have pushed fore have been enacted; (3) Saudi Arabia still supports Islamist proxies in Syria; (4) at least one high-profile ""radical"" prince, Alwaleed, has been released and still has a large amount of his multi-billion dollar fortune; and (5) Saudi Arabia never renounced Wahhabism. If Saudi Arabia is moderating, it is only doing so slightly. So what would be a better explanation for bin Salman's purges? What if the real reason for the purges was because the targets were loyal or at least sympathetic to another Sunni power that bin Salman sees as a threat to Saudi Arabia's hegemony over the Sunni world? Al-Qaeda? Nah. The Saudis and Al-Qaeda have never been best friends, but they've cooperated and are still cooperating today.  Plus, Al-Qaeda is a terrorist organization. It's not a country, and it will never become as powerful as any existing country unless it somehow seizes power in one of them. But what about Turkey? If Turkey is such a threat to Saudi hegemony over the Sunni world, bin Salman would have a very good reason to purge the government of Turkish sympathizers. And, oh yeah. Bin Salman *does* view Turkey as such a threat, given [this statement here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-turkey/saudi-prince-says-turkey-part-of-triangle-of-evil-egyptian-media-idUSKCN1GJ1WW), where he basically equates Turkey and Iran as being on the same level of evil.
* **The killing of Jamal Khashoggi.** At first, I was willing to give Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt over this one. I don't exactly trust Erdogan, and when this incident first happened, I believed that there was a real possibility that it may have been a false flag by the Turks to either justify a Cold War of Hegemony with Saudi Arabia, sabotage US-Saudi relations, or both. But after it was reported that [Saudi Arabia was planning to release a statement admitting its role in Khashoggi's murder](https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-plans-to-admit-khashoggi-murder-scapegoat-general-report-2018-10), and that [cleaning crews had arrived at the consulate where the murder is believed to have occurred just before Turkish inspectors arrived](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/saudis-to-allow-turkish-investigators-to-search-consulate/2018/10/15/4f1fd074-d000-11e8-a4db-184311d27129_story.html), I realized that Saudi Arabia was guilty as charged on this one. Given [Khashoggi's ties to the Muslim Brotherhood](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia.html) (and by extension Erdogan), once again, we have a situation where a desire to maintain hegemony over the Sunni world was a factor.

Right now, it appears that we have a case of Thucydides's Trap, with Saudi Arabia being the declining power and Turkey being the rising power. If that's the case, then we need to prepare for the worst.  [Reviewing the past five hundred years, the Harvard Thucydides’s Trap Project has identified sixteen cases in which a major rising power has threatened to displace a major ruling power. **Twelve of these sixteen rivalries ended in war**.](https://www.belfercenter.org/thucydides-trap/case-file)  And that's not even counting rivalries between lesser powers. Given how weird and almost irrational Saudi Arabia's responses have been so far, plus the imperialistic attitudes and general ruthlessness of both bin Salman and Erdogan, I'm convinced that this is going to be a rivalry that will *not* end peacefully.

Do you agree with this assessment? And if so, what do you think this bodes for the region, and the rest of the world?"

My assertion is that the UN hasn't actively prevented a genocide. Of course, it's possible the UN prevented a genocide by existing but that's unprovable and is getting into butterfly theory territory. The Bosnian Serb genocide is a good example of post-genocide intervention, but overall the UN has been lambasted for not intervening despite being present. 

Similarly, the UN hasn't successfully prevented a war since it was founded. They have (sort of) successfully intervened in many conflicts, but this typically doesn't end the conflict and generally makes it worse because it just builds animosity. The UN has certainly mediated conflicts, but I think this would have taken place without the UN.

This is essentially a state sponsored aquisition. The US is using it's political leverage to force the hand of one of the most popular apps in the world. The fact that Trump thinks the US government should get a portion of money for brokering the deal is a slippery slope (imo). It shows that the government is now a corporate entity, except one that weilds a military and has the power of law on its side. Not to mention that any deal like this could only involve high cap companies that can afford it. The biggest companies in the US will benefit from this in the short term.

I can see a future where this new kind of economic warfare leads to severing the deep ties of the US and Chinese economies. China already does this to some extent (the US too) but never before have I seen such blatant anti-free-market policy from the US, the leaders of globalism!

I doubt the CCP will just let it slide. They already block some US tech companies like Facebook from operating but they're still many that have a large Chinese presence (Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Disney). If Microsoft buys TikTok I could see it hurting Microsoft's bottom line in China. 

I think this could usher in an age of unentangling of the two economies. If the Chinese did something similar with the above companies, and instead promoted their own state sponsored companies, share prices of these huge US companies would tank, and considering they make up a large portion of the S&P 500, the stock market as a whole could tank.

How could the Chinese retaliate? They obviously don't have the capabilities to replace these companies yet but I think it's almost a guarantee they're thinking about it. The Chinese and US economies are so deeply tied that a separation would hurt both sides enormously. Not to mention China owns a large portion of US debt.

Then there's the fact that China cannot  stand up to the US militarily so they're limited in their power projection.

**I thought this article would be of interest to the geopolitics discussion community**

**We wrote a brief history of the Nile dispute since the late 1800s to the present day, and how Ethiopia's grand Renaissance Dam project is reclaiming the Nile for the country where most of the river's water originates, but how this leaves Egypt on the brink of severe water stress with little policy options to respond**

*""Ethiopia sees the Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) as a vital project for its future development. However, the dam will potentially reduce the amount of Nile water flowing to downstream Egypt.*

*Egyptians fear that it will have a catastrophic impact on their country, depriving them of the water they need for drinking and growing crops, and possibly causing famine and drought.*

*Throughout its history, Egypt has been dependent on the Nile and this dependence has not reduced in recent times. Nearly 88 percent of Egypt's water supply comes from the great river and more than 85 percent of the Nile water flowing to Egypt comes from Ethiopia.*

*Egypt already has one of the lowest per capita water consumption rates in the world, at 570 cubic metres per year. The global average is 1,000 cubic metres per year. Ethiopia, however, has an even lower per capita consumption rate than Egypt, at 125 cubic metres per year.*

*There are international agreements regulating the amount of Nile water Egypt receives. A 1959 treaty between Egypt and Sudan gave 55.5 billion cubic metres of water to Egypt and 18.5 billion cubic metres to Sudan. But the upstream African states where the Nile originates from, including Ethiopia, were not a party to these agreements. Ethiopia has never recognised the Egyptian-Sudanese agreement and until construction of the GERD began in March 2011, Ethiopia was unable to effectively use the Nile's water.*

*This has been seen as a source of shame and a signifier of underdevelopment in the country where most of the Nile's water originates.""""*

Why Iran benefits from these attacks,385,0.76,c0gi8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/c0gi8b/why_iran_benefits_from_these_attacks/,377,2019-6-14,"So yesterday happened and the reaction I've found all across reddit has ranged from disbelief to confusion, so I thought I'd try to share my reasoning as to why I think these attacks benefit Iran the most. Given I believe that all countries involved in this mess are rational and intelligent actors(Except maybe Saudi Arabia on the intelligent  part), this means that if Iran is behind this attack then it was act of genius.


**Background**

Before we get to yesterday's events, it's worth summarizing what brought us here.
As you all know, the US has been imposing increasingly restrictive sanctions on Iran for over a year now, and has managed to dramatically decrease Iranian oil exports and coerce unwilling nations to abide by these sanctions using the threat of secondary sanctions. What's important to note here is that unlike the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime, the international buy-in is less due to desire and more due to coercion. Iran knows this.

As the US added sanction atop sanction, Iran kept threatening to shut down the strait of Hormuz in response, in the logic of ""If we can't sell our oil, neither can the Gulf states!"". The US did not take these threats lightly, which is good given Iran did not make them lightly. The first real attack on oil shipping happened last month, in a method quite similar to this attack. Iran was implicated, the West accused and warned, and we're back to the status quo. This attack however, has more sinister implications because of its timing.


**Timing of the Attack**

What sets apart last month's attacks from this one are two things related to its timing:

1) It comes after a Bolton-issued ultimatum that any attack in the Gulf will be met by a grave response.

2) It comes during a visit by the Japanese PM aimed solely at decreasing tensions.

I want to dwell on the significance of the second point, given I doubt anyone here needs an explanation about why point 1 is relevant. Why is PM Abe in Iran? No, he's not going to mediate to curry brownie-points with Trump, Japan has vital matters of national interest attached to this issue for a large chunk of its oil supply passes through these straits. It's essential that they remain open, and the country sees that this rise of tensions might threaten this supply. 

So as the Japanese PM is in Tehran trying to stave off this nightmare scenario, guess what happens? East Asia bound oil ships get attacked, and this was not lost on Japan as the government immediately stated that these ships had 'Japan-related' cargo on board. Immediately following the attack, Iran moved onto the PR front. Tweets by Khameini directed towards Japan urging it to ignore the US sanctions regime it was forced to buy into, statements by the Iranian government immediately getting ahead of the curve and setting the propaganda narrative, and even a statement saying something to the effect that Iran is the safety guarantor of the strait of Hormuz.

All of this happened and there was still radio silence from Western Capitals, who were either caught unawares or were trying to keep the markets calm or even both. 

**What is the message Iran sent?**

Through this well executed and well timed attack, Iran sent an important message to the coalition of the unwilling:

""The US is not able to guarantee freedom of navigation, and has forced you to buy into a sanctions regime you do not want to buy into and has left you to fend for yourselves as your ships get attacked in response.""

Japan and India, both importers of Iranian oil, were very reluctant about falling into line due to the threats to their oil supplies. Europe is also reluctant given the effects of any conflict would be acutely felt on the continent. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of countries that bought into Iran sanctions by coercion and also by the assumption that the US will protect them from their fears.

Even without all of that, a corner stone of US foreign policy and power is its intent and ability to keep shipping lanes open. In one fell swoop, Iran attacked this principle in a brazen way that obviously took everyone by surprise.

But if the Americans don't act to show the world that they are still guarantors of Free Navigation and that they will protect nations from the negative effects of the sanctions it forced them to buy into, then we will start seeing the unraveling of the sanctions regime sooner rather than later.

This is what the Iranians are hoping to gain from this attack, and this is why the American response in the coming days will be consequential. To me, this is a moment equal in gravity to Obama's Red Line although it might not feel like it now."

US ban on Huawei is a gamble.,385,0.93,bqzuvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/bqzuvl/us_ban_on_huawei_is_a_gamble/,130,2019-5-21,"For the ICT industry, the US blockade of Huawei is actually a gamble.

Most of the global ICT manufacturing industry chain and brands are concentrated in East Asia. There are five global chip buyers in the East Asia region (Samsung, Huawei, Lenovo, BBK, Xiaomi). Among Apple's 200 largest global suppliers, 139 (almost 70%) are from East Asia. At the same time, for the 807 factories of Apple's 200 largest suppliers worldwide, only 62(7.7%) in the United States. while 605 in East Asia (China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan), accounting for 75%, of which China accounts for 47.76%. USA is actually marginalized in this manufacturing field. Beyond the East Asian industrial chain, the United States is like an isolated island, so it must remain open, participate and integrate into the East Asian industrial chain.

&#x200B;

Most of the components manufacturing involved in the ICT industry have long gone in the United States.

It is difficult for this industry chain to return to the United States. Currently the unemployment rate in the United States is not high, so the manufacturing industry can only attrract talents by offering higher salaries. At the same time the demographic changes in the United States are also difficult to support large-scale manufacturing employment.

&#x200B;

The biggest advantage of Americans lies in the semiconductor designing and the manufacturing of some semiconductor products. The United States is far away from East Asia, which is the center of ICT manufacturing, and this is a natural disadvantage.

&#x200B;

Because the component suppliers and down stream product brands are gathered in East Asia, they have their own will to purchase semiconductor products. In other words, If I am a customer, I have my own choice, I can buy from you or buy from others.

Currently, American companies have advantages in the semiconductor technology, so the downstream companies have no choice, they have to buy from USA to participate in the division of labor to obtain profits.

&#x200B;

The United States promoting the blockade of Huawei, in fact, is promoting China to invest more at the core advantages of the United States, and once China catches up in this area and finds that it can fully realize the internal circulation of the ICT industry, without the need to purchase from US companies thousands of miles away, then the US semiconductor industry, being far away from the East Asian industry chain manufacturing center, will only be gradually replaced.

&#x200B;

This story has happened a lot. an example is Shenzhen Huiding Technology. The world's largest fingerprint identification company is in Europe --- Sweden's FPC, and when Chinese companies found that Huiding's domestic fingerprint identification chips are also capable enough, OPPO, VIVO, Huawei, and others have all switched to Huiding, so there are no opportunities for similar companies in Europe and the United States anymore, they have to gradually withdraw from the industrial chain.

&#x200B;

In this sense, USA is playing with fire. If USA insists on blocking Huawei for one or two years, then for the United States, those American technology companies with weaker technology will be affected first, because one year later, They will find out that they have been replaced by local Chinese suppliers permanently, because the US government's crackdown on ZTE and Huawei has given Chinese local chip companies that did not have the opportunity to participate in market competition.

Once you are replaced, it is very difficult to enter the East Asian industry chain again. This is why it is so important for Americans to return manufacturing and the industrial chain to the United States.

&#x200B;

This is a competition in which China is scrambling for technological advances in the semiconductor field,

while the Americans are striving to maintain the advantages of semiconductor technology while get the industry chain returning to the United States.

At present, China already has a large number of global brands,  China's industrial chain also have a large number of component manufacturers ---- camera modules, CMOS sensors, mobile phone processors, OLED display panels, mobile phone lenses, glass covers, metal processing, FPC and circuit boards have successively made breakthroughs and being shipped on a large scale. SMIC's FinFET 12nm process, YMTC's 64 layer Nand Flash, Changxin's DRAM4 is about to be mass-produced in a few months.

&#x200B;

If the industry chain is firmly in the hands of China, then only the semiconductors will be left for the United States.

Once Chinese companies made technology breakthroughs, there is no need from the US companies. As long as the technology is on par for the two countries, the US products will be replaced soon, and once replaced, it will almost never come back.

&#x200B;

For Huawei, ZTE, OPPO, VIVO, and Xiaomi, since they can buy it in Shenzhen, why should they buy it from the United States?

The ZTE incident in 2018 lasted for almost three months from April to July. The US chip share has been permanently reduced in ZTE's procurement process. ZTE has increased its procurement of self-produced, domestically produced, and other non-US-based chips, which is a permanent loss for US semiconductor companies.

&#x200B;

Huawei's capacity is seven times that of ZTE. It is one of the only three billion-dollar electronic technology companies in the world. In 2018, Huawei's global semiconductor purchases reached US$21.131 billion, an increase of 45.2%. This is also why the US semiconductor company's stock has plummeted after Huawei received a ban.

&#x200B;

This also makes the United States face a situation:

If the ban is persistent, not only the semiconductor suppliers in the United States will be affected, after all, it is very painful to lose a large customer; At the same time, Huawei's customers around the world will also be affected, including the United States. The impact is global.

Even if this ban is revoked in the future, the share of US semiconductor companies in Huawei will be permanently lost or reduced, which will actually weaken the advantages of American semiconductor companies. In other words, once this decision is made, the United States will suffer a lot loss, whether or not the ban is lifted.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, If the Chinese government suddenly announces a ban on Samsung or Apple, China's domestic component suppliers cannot sell to Samsung or Apple. they will inevitably suffer severe loss. Once they were kicked out of the supply chain of Apple or Samsung, it would be difficult to join again. So Chinese government would not do that.

&#x200B;

The Trump administration is willing to bear this loss, indicating that they are very determined to weaken China's scientific and technological progress."
Will Russia's inaction regarding Armenia affects its reputation as a security garuntor?,382,0.94,j9648u,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/j9648u/will_russias_inaction_regarding_armenia_affects/,71,2020-10-11,"Russia has in recent years managed to position itself as the ""garuntor"" of certain allies, from national leadership such as Syria's Assad, to non-state actors such as those in Ukraine. This has given them a modicum of repute on the world stage as a good security partner, particularly when balancing against other powers such as the USA.

However, Russia has been conspicuously absent when it comes to Armenia, despite Armenia being a member of the CTSO. Obviously, Russia could argue they have no obligations to Artsakh, but it isn't hard to see that in doing so they're also leaving Armenia to their own fate. Moreso considering Armenia haven't been shy about their need for assistance.

Will this inaction make other states less willing to rely on Russia as a security garuntor? In particular, might central Asian nations now consider looking more to Iran or China?"

Would there be any major geopolitical implications if the oil price fell below 20$ per barrel?,376,0.97,ffqmeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ffqmeg/would_there_be_any_major_geopolitical/,152,2020-3-9,"As I am writing this, the oil price is at 32$ ([source](https://oilprice.com/)) and is showing only small signs of stabilising. The current situation so far seems not to have major impact on geopolitics but if the price was to fall down below 30$ dollars, what in your opinion would be the effect of that on geopolitics (regardless of the region)? 

In the past such low oil prices have caused various shifts in geopolitics. For example here is a small paragraph from a paper called ""Sultans of Swing? The Geopolitics of Falling Oil Prices"". ([link](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Falling-Oil-Prices-English.pdf) \[PDF\])

*""One can cite serious domestic and regional disruptions that have followed severe oil price declines in the recent past. Oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s, falling from their previous height of around $30 per barrel at the beginning of the decade to a low of below $10 per barrel for a few months in 1986. The political crisis that revenue drop occasioned in Algeria eventually culminated in elections won by Islamists, a military coup, and a brutal civil war that would last well into the 1990s. Saddam Hussein’s 1990 invasion of oil-rich Kuwait has also been explained as, at least in part, attributable to his desire to increase Iraq’s revenues at a time of financial stringency and political instability at home.""*"

Abqaiq,372,0.96,d58thq,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/d58thq/abqaiq/,104,2019-9-17,"The Abqaiq attack is the most comprehensive blow against the global energy sector since Iraq’s seizure of Kuwait in 1990. The strike was highly effective from a military perspective. The weapons hit at around 4 a.m. local time and appear to have struck from a northerly or northwesterly direction. This fits with a string of reporting that suggests related air defense alerts and engine sounds were concentrated in areas of the northern Persian Gulf, as opposed to an ingress route from Yemen. Strong US government statements have ruled out Yemen (on September 14) and Iraq (on September 16), so the focus is narrowing to a direct strike originating from Iran.

These factors plus the lack of attempted air defense interception by numerous overlapping Hawk and Patriot missile batteries suggest a low-level cruise missile attack that hugged the ground at altitudes of under 300 feet. The footage seen thus far shows only one crashed missile, indicating that the arrival rate was very high, possibly even 95 percent, and that routes were carefully planned to avoid obstacles such as power lines and communication towers. Seventeen individual impact points were struck at the Abqaiq facility, with a smaller number (perhaps as low as two) at Khurais. The weapons were highly accurate. For instance, all twelve of the (thirty meters wide) spheroid gas-oil separation tanks at Abqaiq were hit almost dead center. Much thinner stabilization towers were also accurately struck. There are even indications of finesse in the strike’s “weaponeering,” the technical term for munition selection and modification. Some aimpoints were clearly hit with large explosive payloads consistent with an Iranian cruise missile such as the 700-kilometer-range ""Ya-Ali"". Yet the separation tanks appear to have been struck with high-velocity kinetic force sans explosions, perhaps signaling an effort to damage but not permanently destroy them. Similar finesse was visible in Iran’s May 12 attacks in the Fujairah anchorage off the United Arab Emirates, where four ships had their hulls expertly holed without causing the vessels to spill oil, sink, or suffer massive fires.

The full level of damage inflicted this Saturday is unknown so far, but considering the range of facilities struck and the long lead times for manufacturing such specialized equipment, the impact on Saudi oil processing capacity could extend into the four-, six-, or even twelve-month timeframe, forcing the kingdom to discontinue offering Arab Light and Arab Super Light grades. This extraordinary outcome would deeply shock oil markets and the Saudi leadership alike. And from a military perspective, no energy sector has been struck so effectively since the US coalition’s precision bombing of Iraq in 1991. Tehran’s intentions are always difficult to read given the wide spectrum of players within its security and diplomatic establishment. Assuming, however, that early indications of a major cruise missile attack launched from Iranian territory prove correct, the strike is a very bold gamble by the country’s leadership. Iran can count on public skepticism to afford it some deniability under any circumstances, but an attack of this magnitude stands a much greater chance of provoking very severe diplomatic and military consequences. If significant portions of the intelligence community conclude that the world’s most important energy site has been hit by unprecedentedly advanced weapons launched directly from Iran or by the regime’s proxies, the finding would challenge not only Riyadh and Washington, but the entire global energy community, including China.

One possibility is that Iranian security officials have decided they can keep testing US and Saudi resolve without major consequences, perhaps with the goal of shaking or shattering both their trust in each other and their determination to confront Tehran. After all, Iran’s gradually escalating thrusts have all been issued with no real consequences, from the May 12 Fujairah attacks to the May 14 attack on Saudi Arabia’s East-West Pipeline, the June 14 daylight attack on two tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, and the June 20 shootdown of a U.S. drone. More immediately, Tehran may aim to compel the West into granting it sanctions relief in exchange for reducing such attacks and freezing its recent acceleration of nuclear activities. If so, it may believe that Abqaiq will merely strengthen its leverage rather than changing the game altogether.

For this episode we have  
JONATHON WINER - Former Deputy Assistant US Secretary of State and Special Envoy to Libya  
JALEL HARCHAOUI - The Clingendael Institute  
and TAREK MEGERISI - European Council on Foreign Relations

We go over how the struggle started, where its heading and what is at stake for both sides and just how wide-ranging the impacts of the war will be. We also go right into why Russia, Turkey, Italy, France, Qatar, Egypt, Tunisia and the UAE are pouring weapons and arms into this already destructive war.  


Its designed to be a crash course on everything you need to know to try and understand the country in its current state, what the Gulf states, Turkey and Russia are up to, and why the US is staying out of it for now.   


We also decided to leave it some of the more controversial points this time, including the outcomes of the US taking drastic measures into the war.

Will 2019 see a major geopolitical re-alignment in the Middle East?,371,0.97,ab87js,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ab87js/will_2019_see_a_major_geopolitical_realignment_in/,50,2018-12-31,"During the last two months of 2018, four major developments have occurred in Syria.

First, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates [deployed troops](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20181122-saudi-arabia-uae-send-troops-to-support-kurds-in-syria/) into Northern Syria to be stationed with American troops and their Kurdish allies.

Second, the United States [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/trump-syria-turkey-troop-withdrawal.html) that it was withdrawing all forces from Syria.

Third, the Kurds [asked](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/syrias-kurds-ask-assad-govt-for-protection) the Assad regime to protect them following the American withdrawal announcement.

And fourth, the Gulf states [began to join](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/12/28/bashar-al-assad-was-diplomatic-outcast-now-former-arab-adversaries-are-restoring-ties/?utm_term=.da0109a61404) other Arab states in restoring diplomatic ties with the Assad regime following the American withdrawal announcement.

In light of these developments, one has to ask: will we see a major geopolitical re-alignment in the Middle East in 2019?

Let's take these developments and put them into context. [As I have stated before](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9ozhcd/have_saudi_arabia_and_turkey_entered_a_cold_war/), much of Saudi Arabia's -- and by extension the Gulf states minus Qatar's -- recent foreign policy has been in response to Turkey's growing power and potential to threaten the traditional Saudi/Gulf state hegemony of the Sunni world in general and the Sunni world within the Middle East in particular. If Saudi Arabia wants to contain Turkey, the both the deployment of Saudi and Emirati troops into Northern Syria and the Kurdish/Gulf state efforts to reconcile with Assad would absolutely make sense.

And if Assad accepts these olive branches, that could change everything.

No, that's not an understatement.

In the aftermath of such a scenario, we must pay close attention to five countries:

1. **Turkey**. Relations between Turkey and much of the Arab world are already at an all-time low. Turkey's relationship with Syria and Egypt have completely collapsed over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's support of anti-government movements in those countries. Meanwhile, tensions between Turkey and every Gulf state except Qatar have been growing for geopolitical (and to a lesser extent ideological) reasons. Turkey's relationship with Saudi Arabia in particular has deteriorated following the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. And then of course, there are the Kurds, no explanation needed there. A newly-found friendship between Assad, the Gulf states, and the Kurds would likely make their relations with Turkey even worse, as the Turks sense a clear attempt at containment in Northern Syria.
2. **Iran.** Iran's relations with the Gulf states (especially Saudi Arabia but minus Qatar) are even worse than Turkey's relations with those countries.  For this reason, there is a good chance that the Iranian response to a reconciliation between Assad and the Gulf states will be harsher than the Turkish response. But how far will Iran go? If history indicates anything, all options appear to be on the table. Just over a year ago, former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was assassinated by his former (Iranian-backed) Houthi allies after he attempted to reconcile with the Gulf States in the midst of a civil war in his country. If Iran and/or its proxies could turn against and/or kill Saleh over his communications with the Gulf states, then they could do the same with Assad. Should they pursue that course of action, there can be only two outcomes. First, if Assad is killed or overthrown, that would likely make the war in Syria much, *much* worse. Not only could such an event start a new wave of uprisings, we could also see some of Assad's former allies within the country *joining* those uprisings over the issue of Syria's relationship with Iran. Alternatively, if Assad is *not* killed or overthrown, the Syrian-Iranian alliance would collapse. Syria would defect from the pro-Iranian camp to the pro-Saudi camp, while Iran would switch sides in the war -- and perhaps form an alliance with Turkey in the process.
3. **Russia.** If the Syrian-Iranian alliance collapsed, Russia would face a serious predicament. It would be forced to choose which ally is more strategically important: Syria or Iran. If Russia chooses Syria, then it gets to keep its naval base in Tartus and enjoy better relations with the Gulf states, but it also loses any clout it once had with Iran and Turkey to use against American influence in the region and perhaps faces a greater risk of terrorist attacks on its soil. If Russia chooses Iran, then it solidifies the ""Eurasian Alliance"" with Iran and Turkey against American influence in the region, but it also loses its naval base in Tartus and perhaps suffers its greatest humiliation on the international stage since the end of the Cold War.
4. **The United States.** If the outcome of the reconciliation between Assad, the Gulf states, and the Kurds results in them moving closer to Russia, the United States could be very tempted to forge closer ties with Iran and Turkey to form a regional counterbalance. Should that happen, we could end up seeing Donald Trump doing a 180 on some of his current Middle East policies, such as opposition to a nuclear deal with Iran, recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and support of a Saudi-led ""Arab NATO.""
5. **Israel.** Israel's number one priority right now is Iran. If you're anti-Iran, you're the good guy, according to Israel. If Turkey, Russia, or the United States form closer ties with Iran as a result of the new re-alignment, odds are Israel's relations with those countries will seriously deteriorate in coming years.

Why Kyrgyzstan?,357,0.97,g9v4ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/g9v4ib/why_kyrgyzstan/,30,2020-4-29,"In late January, the Trump Administration extended the travel ban to [six additional countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/us/politics/trump-travel-ban.html): Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar, and Kyrgyzstan. One can construe various reasons that these travel ban extensions were made: in Nigeria, Boko Haram [continues](https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/boko-haram-nigeria) to destabilize the region, despite the potential of the Nigerian economy; Eritria and Sudan, respectively, have been a hub for piracy and there are still questions about the future of the Sudanese government. Myanmar has been a focal-point for human rights amidst a refugee crisis. The two on this list that do not fit any obvious policy are Tanzania and Kyrgyzstan. For Tanzania, issues about their ""identity management and information-sharing criteria"" have been [cited](https://globalvoices.org/2020/02/07/tanzania-slapped-with-us-travel-ban-individual-sanctions-amid-deteriorating-human-rights-situation/).

In the case of Kyrgyzstan, however, it is less clear. Central Asia generally gets less coverage than the other states cited. There are several possible reasons:

* There have been a few issues with passport security. Last year, a scandal regarding Kyrgyzstan's introduction of a new biometric passport system surfaced after [allegations of bribery](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/multimillion-passport-deal-under-investigation-in-kyrgyzstan) from the Lithuanian company that won the bid, Garsu Pasaulis, surfaced. I could not find any further information regarding the development of this investigation.
* Another separate scandal in which a Chinese-born Uyghur with a fake passport [reportedly](https://www.rferl.org/a/kyrgyz-protesters-call-for-punishment-for-those-involved-in-corruption-scandal/30331892.html) funneled around $1 billion out of the country through a money-laundering operation. It is especially damaging when not only was the accused, Aierken Saimaiti, was seen at the President Jeenbekov's 2017 inauguration. Saimaiti was found shot dead on November 10 in Turkey.

Certainly, these are issues: but are they worth banning travel for [students](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/im-an-american-in-kyrgyzstan-the-travel-ban-has-my-us-loving-students-despairing/2020/02/11/3c0321e6-491a-11ea-b4d9-29cc419287eb_story.html) and ordinary citizens? On the Eastern side of Europe, we can see similar corrupt practices, such as Moldova's infamous [$10 billion theft](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2016/08/01/billion-dollar-theft-in-moldova-one-rich-bankers-crime-has-a-nation-doing-time/#27a018024f7e) by Plahotniuc - this has not warranted a travel ban. And even with the *new* passport system compromised by corruption, would not the original passport system be sufficient? As the stakes are raising with US/CCP, does the Kyrgyz passport issues and its possible exposure to Xinjiang Province border, could this be a factor? This is speculation, but its worth considering.

The reason I ask these questions is because the US has generally had a stake in Kyrgyzstan. The US had a military base in the country until 2014. The country has been hailed as one of the few ""genuinely"" democratic countries of Central Asia. Compared to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, it stands out as a country that has been willing to tolerate political freedoms and espouse democratic values. Even more, it is the site of a potential Uzbek-Kyrgyz Railway that has considerable [problems](https://www.mei.edu/publications/ferghana-valley-railway-should-never-be-built) with [funding](https://www.railfreight.com/beltandroad/2019/11/04/from-china-to-iran-via-kyrgyzstan-is-faster-rail-link-real/) and development, specifically in relation to the ""debt-trap"" argument.

The proposed railway would potentially aid the Iranian economy. It is the most convenient route from China to reach Iranian/Turkish/Western European markets. This is a potential red-flag for the State Dept; however, why the US would double down and isolate Kyrgyzstan does not make much sense to me, if the US wishes to retain any influence in the Chinese periphery - which to me, would seem logical. To me, it appears to be poor judgment in US Foreign Policy interests, as it simply gives up on the Kyrgyz card, purposefully giving up on supporting a genuine Central Asian democracy unlike any other in the region.

In short, what I believe is happening is the United States is truly turning its back on developing democracies in support of containing the Belt and Road Initiative, given Kyrgyzstan's geopolitical position and the US' desire to get out of Afghanistan. It is in indication that the United States is no longer committed to even promoting democracy abroad, but a pure realist strategy that abandons legitimate gains in democratic institutions and human rights, even if they are flawed, in pursuit of greater geopolitical objectives."
"If America withdraws from Asia, can a rearmed and nuclear Japan serve as a reliable counterbalance to China?",359,0.92,flge84,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/flge84/if_america_withdraws_from_asia_can_a_rearmed_and/,140,2020-3-20,"Hypothetically, in the extremely unlikely case where there is a large-scale drawdown of American military presence from East Asia, can Japan serve as a counterweight to China's geopolitical ascendancy? This is supposing that Japan (which possesses substantial nuclear breakout capacity) becomes a full-fledged nuclear power and rearms conventionally, shedding or circumventing its constitutional limitations. Will such a Japan be enough to counterbalance Chinese hegemony?

Personally, I have my doubts. I recall Lee Kuan Yew saying that even Japan combined with all the Northeast Asian and Southeast Asian states cannot balance China. ""Without the US, the balance is not maintainable."" I'm not sure if he was referring to a nuclear and rearmed Japan, though.

What about a Japan-India axis? Would that be sufficient?

PS: Not just a counterbalance in military terms but also economic, infrastructural, technological, other aspects of soft power etc. Essentially what I want to know is, can East Asia NOT become unipolar  
PS: Please note I'm not talking about full-scale war or even Cold-War style aggressive containment (I honestly doubt there is any unanimity about Southeast Asian states about the desirability of such containment. I don't think it is even possible to ""contain"" China in that sense). I'm talking about balancing. Can Japan by itself or in some other combination of  other states change the grand strategic equation such that the region will not become unipolar"

We hear so much about Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov in the West but very little people focus on the actual nation of Turkmenistan, and with the 4th largest gas reserves in the world, we really should be paying more attention to their potential.

The more you dig into Turkmenistan the more complicated it gets, like being incredibly reliant on exports whilst at the same time being one of the most closed-off nations in the world. Like having an airport the size of Tel-Aviv, whilst only receiving 10,000 tourists a year on average. It's one of the most fascinating and perplexing nations we have ever dug into.

We also dive into the Russian aggression in the Caspian, the current large protests in Turkmenabat (largest since the breakup of the USSR), the pipelines to China and India, as well as the preparation the country is going through if things turn sour in Afghanistan. 

This sub was absolutely great for research, so thank you to all of the people here. 

Would love your input and feedback as well.

A rundown of the ideological roots and history of the Kashmir conflict,343,0.87,awjuf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/awjuf8/a_rundown_of_the_ideological_roots_and_history_of/,100,2019-3-3,"I recently typed up a rather large comment on this sub and decided that I should go ahead and make it its own post. I've seen a ton of disinformation going around about the Kashmir conflict and I hope this can help alleviate some of that. While I am not Indian myself, I am pro-Indian, but have done my best to remain neutral through this post. 

When the British withdrew, they allowed the so called ""princely states"" to choose to [accede to India or Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_of_Accession). They were given three choices, join Pakistan, India or become independent. Most states chose to accede to India or Pakistan.

Another important factor to consider is ideology --

Pakistan saw itself as the protector of Muslims on the subcontinent and an Islamic State. It's very existence was based on its Islamic character and the two nation theory

India, meanwhile rejected the two nation theory and declared itself secular. This ideology split is important as we go on

As I said, most of the princely states chose to accede to the nation which it was surrounded by or according to religious demography

The notable examples which chose to be independent or has contentious entries:

* Junagadh: A huge, huge majority Hindu with a Muslim ruler. No land border with Pakistan. Ruler chose to join Pakistan and Pakistan accepted. India invaded and held a referendum in which 99.95% chose to join India. Pakistan went after this claim for a while but I don't know if they still claim it

* Hyderabad: Another Hindu majority state with a Muslim monarch, this time, with a history extreme religious oppression thrown in. This is an extremely odd case because it's entirely landlocked by India and is a Southern State (current day Andhra). Ruler wanted to be independent, than acceded to Pakistan. There was a short war and India managed to invade it.

* Kalat: A Muslim ruled province with a Muslim majority. The ruler desperately didn't want to be a part of Pakistan. It's hard to find info, but after considering independence, Afghanistan and Iran, he asked to be admitted into India. The prime minister of India refused as India has no land border with Kalat and it's on the far side of Pakistan.

* Sikkim: The only princely state that actually managed to be independent. Not really important but if your wondering, anti monarchist sentiment forced a referendum to join India in the seventies.

This brings us the Jammu and Kashmir. The ruler wanted to be independent. The Pakistanis invaded. He declared for India. The Indians stopped the advance of the Pakistanis and the Line of Control was established where they were stopped, acting as a de facto border.

Remember how I said the religious ideologies of the states were important? Kashmir is the reason why. 

The reverse of Kashmir's situation (King acceding to Pakistan, India taking it) happen twice, in Hyderabad and Jungadh. Pakistan pursued these, but realistically, as an ideologically Islamic state with no land border with those provinces, Pakistans claim was weak and the logistics of supporting territory landlocked or surrounded by an enemy was weaker. 

In Jammu and Kashmir, you have a situation where both sides have some sort of ideological claim over it (Pakistan saying its majority Muslim, while legally, it was Indias' as the king acceded). It strengthens both nations ideologically -- it's a Muslim majority province, giving Pakistan legitimacy in the title of the protector the subcontinents Muslims and India legitimacy in its title as a secular state.

To make matters more complicated, Jammu and Kashmir is divided internally into several areas. While Pakistan may have some claim over the Muslim parts of Kashmir, it's pretty hard to justify them also claiming the districts like Jammu and Ladakh (which are extremely pro-India and majority Hindu and Buddhist respectively)

As Owen Dixon, the man the UN appointed to resolve the conflict pointed out, Ladakh and Jammu were in very much in favor of India. Azad Kashmir were in favor of Pakistan. The only people that remained undecided is the Kashmir Valley. Dixons' plan was to hold a referendum in just this area. This was rejected by Pakistan.

Adding in another layer of complexity, while Pakistan can't claim Jammu on religious grounds, it treats it as a single unit with Kashmir as it needs Jammu for national security reasons (read: securing its water supply)

BONUS ROUND:

You thought the situation was confusing now? This was just the basics. Let me confuse you even more

* India was in favor of holding a referendum the referendum until 1954, when the US and Pakistan signed an arms treaty. They withdrew their offer after said treaty was signed

* Article 370 of the Indian constitution prevents anyone from migrating to Jammu and Kashmir

* Pakistani Kashmir on the other hand has only a minority of Kashmiris

* According to the few polls on the subject Indian and Pakistani Kashmir are actually not in favor of India or Pakistan... But independence. Surprisingly, while 7% of Kashmiris in the Kashmir Valley (India) wanted to stay with India, 3% of Azad Kashmiris (Pak) wanted to stay with Pakistan. These are both dwarfed by those wanting independence in both nations, which are in the mid 40's

* There used to be a sizable minority of Hindus in Kashmir. There was a genocide which killed and expelled pretty much the whole population by Islamic terrorists (1985-95)

* Not to be outdone, there was a massacre against Muslims in Jammu, with around 20k-100k Muslim deaths at the hands of the King of Kashmir and 20k+ Hindu deaths at the hands of Pakistani soldiers (1947)

* Pakistan gave up an uninhabited but strategically valuable part of its Kashmiri territory to China. Enter player 3.

* The main terror group in Kashmir, the same one which committed the recent terror attack, ""JeM"" has connections to the Taliban, was formed by Punjabis fighting in Afghanistan, is majority non Kashmiri and has a stated goal of ""expelling all non Muslims from the subcontinent"". No they are not 'freedom fighters'

edit: It appears I was mistaken, there is no Pakistani policy against independence in a possible referendum

Given the world inability to act, the current climate trends aren't looking good and mirroring some of the worst case projections, climate change will have huge geopolitical implications.

That is especially true for articles about the rise of African nations and Asia, though it is those region that will be hit hardest by warming temperatures.  [India for example is  the most vulnerable country behind Pakistan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-hsbc/india-most-vulnerable-country-to-climate-change-hsbc-report-idUSKBN1GV20Z)  to climate change, yet I've basically never see this talked about, when discussing the challenges India is facing on its way to become a regional or world power. 

On the other side, when discussing the decline of American and European power, I seldom see mentioned the fact that specifically Europe, sitting on huge water reserves and enjoying a relatively milder and more stable climate in average, and, to a lesser degree, the USA are in a much better position to deal with climate change, while simultaneously facing less severe effects of climate change when compared with other regions.

Is there a particular reason why so many analyses just disregard the effects of climate change?

Donald Trump threatens escalation of trade war with China: US President says tariffs will be ‘raised very substantially’ if no truce is reached,345,0.96,dvgm25,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/dvgm25/donald_trump_threatens_escalation_of_trade_war/,99,2019-11-13,"https://www.ft.com/content/ef7d04c2-0576-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd

President Donald Trump threatened a new escalation of the trade war with China, saying US tariffs on Chinese goods would be “raised very substantially” if no truce was reached with officials in Beijing. 

Mr Trump’s comments at the Economic Club of New York highlight the trouble the US administration is having in its efforts to strike an interim deal with China that would bring a halt to the commercial conflict afflicting the world’s two largest economies. 

After Mr Trump announced that a tentative agreement had been secured in early October, US and Chinese officials have been haggling over the details, including where a deal would be signed and whether Washington would roll back existing levies as part of such a settlement.


Mr Trump said a “significant phase one deal with China” remained “close” and “could happen soon”, as Beijing was “dying to make a deal”. But he also warned that higher levies would follow if the talks faltered.

I tell it to everybody: If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs

President Donald Trump on US trade talks with China
The US has placed 25 per cent tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports and 15 per cent tariffs on a further $112bn of Chinese goods. It has threatened new 15 per cent tariffs on a further $156bn of Chinese products in December. 

“I tell it to everybody: If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs, they are going to be raised very substantially,” Mr Trump warned. 

Mr Trump used the speech in New York, his hometown, to defend his administration’s protectionist trade policies and his economic record ahead of next year’s presidential election campaign

He said his administration had “delivered on our promises and exceeded our expectations” after nearly three years in office, but blamed the Federal Reserve for restraining growth under his watch. 

The president, who has frequently challenged the Fed’s independence by demanding easier monetary policy, said the US was at a “competitive disadvantage” because it had not followed the eurozone into the land of negative rates. 

“Give some of that money, I want some of that money,” he said. The Fed has cut interest rates three times this year, after raising them last year, but has since suggested it will pause easing for the time being. 

Mr Trump’s remarks came at a pivotal moment in his presidency, on the eve of public impeachment hearings over the Ukraine scandal in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and less than a year from the 2020 presidential election. Mr Trump wants to tout his economic prowess as a key selling point in the 2020 campaign, in a bid to hold on to the swing voters who propelled him to the White House in the race against Hillary Clinton in 2016. 

“We have ended the war on American workers, we have stopped the assault on American industry, and we have launched an economic boom the likes of which we have never seen before,” Mr Trump said. 

Despite record highs in US stock markets, persistently low unemployment and strong consumption, there have been some warning signs for the US president about the health of the economy. The pace of growth has slowed throughout the year, with both agricultural producers and manufacturers in the American heartland bearing the brunt of the trade wars and weakening global output. 

This has exposed Mr Trump to criticism from Democrats that his policies have backfired, failing to live up to their promise of boosting the prospects of average middle-class households Despite all the pressure exerted through tariffs, the US administration has failed to secure any major concessions from China on the toughest trade issues like industrial subsidies and the theft of intellectual property. 

US agrees limited trade deal with China
Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think-tank, said: “This laughable cheerleading in front of Wall Street pretty much sums up Trump’s economic agenda: no real results for the country at large, but delivering for the titans of Wall Street and corporate monopolies.”

Mr Trump’s more pugnacious, protectionist approach to trade has been a cornerstone of his economic agenda from the beginning of his presidency — and many businesses have complained that the uncertainty it created has frozen their investment plans.

But Mr Trump appeared to reject those claims. He said: “They were totally down. Now they’re a little bit down because a little bit, perhaps, the uncertainty of trade wars. But there is no uncertainty.”

As they await word on the US-China talks, investors and officials are also closely watching Mr Trump’s decision, expected this week, on whether to impose tariffs on car imports, after labelling them a threat to national security. Mr Trump did not mention the issue, which is a big risk to EU carmakers in particular, but the administration is expected to grant Brussels a new reprieve from the levies."

As some posters correctly pointed out that China is a super power,  and even if you don’t believe they are currently one, they will work their way to become one in the next decade. 

Inspired by the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/dmfcgm/does_america_give_more_or_take_more_from_the_world/) on whether if US give or take more from the world.  It appears the consensus is that some regions are ""winners"" of the US hegemony and some regions are ""losers"" of the US hegemony.

In a situation where China becomes the next super power, which regions will become the ""winners"" and ""losers"" of the Chinese hegemony? Considering the current investments in South America and Africa, these regions may benefit and Japan will likely be a ""loser"" as result of bad history between the two countries.  However, I am not so sure about South Korea, Asia-Pacific, North America (excluding US), Europe and the Middle East.

In the case of a bi-polar world where US and China each has their own sphere of influence, who would fall into each country's sphere?  

Considering incumbencies are difficult to displace, especially in the case where it is not a natural succession (a natural one would be UK succeeding to the US), I think there will be a period of friction.  As with other competing factions that compete for limited resources, how can countries in each ""pole"" use this to their advantage?  I think you already seen something like this with the Philippines, an old US ally, that was for awhile pivoting towards China, but may be regressing back to the US.  How will this play out in other more strategic allies that offer natural resources in exchange for protection (ie Saudi Arabia) as both US and China shift gears in terms of consumption?"

First of all, I'm of the belief that the core issue behind these protests is economic. The most fervent protestors are all youths who see no hope for the future. Those in high school find it hard to get into college because they have to compete with mainlanders. Graduated from college? Good luck getting a job having to compete with experienced mainlanders and foreigners. They see rich mainlanders buying up properties they can never ever hope to afford. Starting a family is out of the question unless you and your new wife are going to live with your parents. Moving is not an option. They are stuck on an island and they have no hope for the future.

That's why they resort to violence and aggressive tactics. It's also why they are trying to appeal to Trump for intervention even though they're smart enough to know he won't. And why they demand universal suffrage despite knowing Xi would never agree. No hope means nothing to lose.

They won't stop until China is forced to declare martial law and sends in the troops. I'm of the belief that their endgame is to invite CCP to commit Tiananmen part 2 right on their doorstep. They want it all to go to hell with the world watching because only then do they have outs. Outs via asylum claims to NA/EU in the face of CCP brutality.

From the CCP's perspective, they don't want another Tiananmen on their hands. Too much flak over these past decades for the first one. Too much risk of economic sanctions. They don't want to disrupt the economy. Thus they'll try to enforce martial law with overwhelming numbers of soldiers wielding nerf weapons. 

The final scene of the film goes like this. The red army and protestors clashing on the streets of HK, with protestors using guerrilla tactics to invite violence and Chinese soldiers trying to arrest everyone without killing anyone. Many are arrested and sent to re-education camps while the ones that make it out resettle overseas and find hope again.

Anyways, my 2 cents. Thanks for reading."

[Meta] The current issues with /r/geopolitics,333,0.96,9sh2si,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9sh2si/meta_the_current_issues_with_rgeopolitics/,115,2018-10-30,"this is all my opinion on what the currents issues are with the subreddit. i haven't been browsing this place for years and i don't have some insider perspective on the moderator team so take it all with a grain of salt. also sorry if this is against the rules but there's no other public setting on the subreddit to post this kind of thing.


1) locking threads doesn't solve the issue of low quality comments. all that it's doing is shutting down our (only) venue of dialogue about the topic at hand whilst simultaneously punishing _every user_ for the actions of a few. i don't believe that it's the best solution to uncivil discussion and that for the most part it's use should be restricted to very rare occasions. instead, i suggest a more stringent approach to the moderation of the comments section i.e. a more iron fisted approach to low-quality and off-topic comments as well as more time dedicated to scanning threads. this would dramatically reduce the amount of low-quality comments whilst still letting regular users discuss the topic.


2) every post that doesn't have a proper submission statement within an hour should be removed (and not locked) regardless of the popularity of the post or number of comments. the current system of letting some popular posts without SS stay up only let's people think they can circumvent the rules without consequence. i personally have experienced this kind of attitude before and i think it's a major contributor to the number of low-quality comments the subreddit gets. 


3) users need to post more sources for their claims; the amount of comments i see on the subreddit spewing nonsense with users refusing/dodging requests for sources has, for my time here, astounded me. as a remedy, i think it should be a rule that if someone asks you for a source then you have to respond and comply otherwise face the consequences from the mods (i.e. having your comment removed/being warned, probably via a report). since as i thought of this remedy i also though of a myriad of ways to exploit it it should also be an offense to abuse it. the enforcement of both of these rules would be left up to the discretion of the moderators.


EDIT REGARDING 3#: i've been told, in nicer terms than this, that my earlier suggestion stinks. and it's true. so taking into consideration what's been said, i would like to make a new suggestion. instead of users being able to request a source at any point in a conversation (which is easily abused) it should be that after a certain timeframe has passed, such as 5 hours after the post was created, the top comment that makes a claim needs to have proper sourcing; this rule is similar to what r/asksocialscience practices. what constitutes as a 'proper source' will be left to the discretion of the moderators. if this is only applied to top comments then i don't think that it'll stymie any discussion since this _is_ a serious forum and top comments should, in theory, be well-crafted and well sourced anyways. for very popular posts (such as those pushing past 150/200 comments, for example) this can be adjusted to the three top comments requiring sources. it should be clarified though that this is solely for the top comments that make a claim; questions and the like are completely fine. 


regarding a comment i saw, if the highest rated post is a question and the second highest makes a claim, the second still needs to provide a source even though it's not technically the top comment. any top comments that don't make a claim, in this context, 'don't count' as top comments.


also, the r/neutralpolitics rules have a decent perspective on what is considered good and bad sources. maybe mods can implement a similar system?


4) there isn't a dedicated place where users can interact with moderators and each other in a meta context. my suggestion is that there should be a new stickied thread every month that acts as a public place to post suggestions, vent about perceived issues and in general as a venue to discuss the subreddit. this would get people more invested in the subreddit, become a link for dialogue between the moderators and the userbase and raise community morale. it would also prevent stupid meta posts like these from popping up every few months.


as someone in the comments suggested, there can also be a weekly ""Newbie Thread"" where some of the more low-quality questions and discussion is encouraged.


5) this is less of an issue and more of a suggestion: a wider implementation of flairs would be a good addition to the subreddit, similar in practice to how /u/sageandonion has a flair crediting them as the editor of Encyclopedia Geopolitica. users could request a flair based on operating a geopolitics website or blog, writing relevant articles, being employed in a geopolitics-related field, etc which can be approved at the discretion of the moderator team. some users who post consistently high-quality comments can also be flaired as well, a sort of acknowledgement of their contributions. this is drawing inspiration from the /r/AskHistorians flair system, adjusted for the differences between subreddits of course.


i know i've probably come off as unappreciative of the moderators in this post and i promise i don't mean to. the /r/geopolitics mod squad are doing a good job as is, especially with the large influx of new posters over the past few months/year. i do think however that everyone should be able to vent openly about what they don't like about the subreddit as well as suggest solutions and that implementing some of these suggestions (mainly number 4) is a good place to start."

* gain a nuclear arsenal, and test them to their limits
* be perceived as one of the greatest threats to the most powerful nation on Earth despite being such a relatively small country

We also take a look into the Russians new Hypersonic missile program and whether this could pose a threat to the US reliance on its carrier fleet. 

For this episode we have  
MARLENE LAURELLE >> Director of the Central Asia Program and director of the PONARS think tank.  
STEPHANIE PEZARD >> Russian Arctic specialist for the RAND corporation.  
PAUL JOSEPHSON >> Author and professor of Russian technological history.  
ROB HUEBERT >> Russian defense expert and professor at the University of Calgary

One of the main focuses of the piece is about the slow opening of the Northeast passage, a shorter Arctic route between East Asia and Europe that is likely to become dominant in a few years. We ask the experts what this means for the balance of power, and if the US could protect their good as it goes through this new route. We also go through whether this development will give Russia the same leverage as Iran or Malaysia with their maritime checkpoints, and what it means for NATO.

Its designed to be a crash course on everything you need to know about the situation, and we learnt a lot making it.

We also decided to leave in some of the more controversial points this time, including the Russian Hypersonic Missile disasters and the Russian Skyfall program.

The show is really starting to pick up and this sub was a huge help in gathering guests and info so I thought I would share it here to say thanks.

Would love your input and feedback as well.

On top of that, they have many strong ties to other countries and plenty of influence in other autocratic countries that could help boost their exports and receive imports at a lower cost.  Not only that, but they are a very resource rich country with SOME population to produce some growth at least (144million).

&#x200B;

I understand that China's population dwarfs Russia and that is a large factor at play here. Also that Russia does not do much trading with the West and has sanctions to deal with as well. I understand that there are some glaring reasons why Russia hasn't developed (outside of Moscow/St. Petersburg), but I still find it odd that some parts of Russia is still SO FAR BEHIND despite the advantages Russia does have."

This threat obviously stands in connection with Germanys low efforts to increase their military budget to 2% of the GDP as promised in NATO treaties.

As a german myself, many people here are not considering this a threat as the amount of people opposing any U.S. military presence is quite big (especially in context of the use of drones via the Rammstein Air Base) and left leaning as well as right leaning groups would support the proposed withdrawal.

&#x200B;

How likely do you think is an american withdrawal of troops (considering that even though their numbers have been reduced, they have been stationed here since 1945)?

How does the U.S. military plan to fill the power vacuum that their withdrawal would create (possibly moving bases to other, maybe eastern european countries like Poland) ?

What kind of geopolitical problems/effects could arise considering that e.g. Germanys military is in a bad shape and a lot of the defensive potential of NATO could be reduced by an U.S. withdrawal?

Who Controls the Caspian Sea?,331,0.96,jqe7a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/jqe7a1/who_controls_the_caspian_sea/,45,2020-11-9,"The Caspian Sea was once effectively a giant Soviet lake, always a second thought when it comes to strategic planning. Moscow and Tehran stayed out of each other's ways, and for 70 years it took a backseat. Today though we have 5 nations competing for the sea, all with separate navies and strategic goals. For some, it is all about the huge gas fields below the surface, and for others it is about an alternative trading path in case of souring relationships with Moscow. So we tried to answer the question ""Who Controls the Caspian Sea?"".  
 

On the panel this week was >>

EUGENE CHAUSOVKEY -  (Centre for Global Policy)  
STANISLAV PRITCHIN - (ECED)  
ROBERT M CUTLER - (NATO Canada)   


Russia has been the dominant power on the sea for a very long time, but this has been in an era when nations like Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iran weren't taking the potential of the Caspian seriously. The situation has changed and Turkmenistan particularly has a huge vested interest in the future here, as 300km of extra pipeline would connect the vast Gas fields of Turkmenistan to the hungry gas market in Europe. As we covered in the previous piece on Turkmenistan, there is enough gas under the surface here to take a big chunk of the EU gas market (something that would hurt Russia energy leverage). 

Russia seems to also be realising this threat as it is currently in the process of moving its major Caspian naval base from Astrakhan in the north of the Caspian, to Kaspiysk in Dagestan. Moving their fleet much closer to the potential pipeline sights, as well as the Azeri naval bases; it also may be a sign of Kremlins' worries about instability in Dagestan itself, but that is another piece for another time.   


All 5 Caspian nations seem to be awakening to the potential of the Sea, so what will be their next moves, and will Russia be able to hold onto their dominance in the area?

Thanks again to this sub as always, it always puts me in the right direction for which guests to approach.

Let me know what you think?

Cuba seems to have been the remarkable exception with Trump only issuing travel restrictions to Cuba [1](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admin-restricts-us-travel-cuba-banning-group/story?id=63478154) [2](https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-to-issue-directive-narrowing-obamas-cuba-opening-1497574800) and thereby also, in effect, de facto reimposing some economic sanctions to the country which the Cubans are already accustomed to. 

Does Cuba have some sort of leverage to insulate themselves from further American influence, or is Cuba simply out of Trump's immediate concern?"

Many thought they were following right in China's path.

But today its become more clear that India faces many obstacles on its way, from its education system to excessive red tape and rising ethno-religious tension. India's government seems to have little idea what to do other than just chugging along.

Realistically, what are some steps India's government can take to become (or at least become closer to) a superpower?"
