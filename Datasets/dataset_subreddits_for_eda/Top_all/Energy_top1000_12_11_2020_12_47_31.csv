My entry is the only one that promotes any form of nuclear power. There was an entry focused on thorium, but it got knocked out before the final round...but that group has formed a team to promote thorium going forward, and I've joined up with them.

Last year I was a winner in this contest. We went to the U.N. and had a nice roundtable discussion with a group that directly advises the Sec Gen on climate change issues. The next week we had a more formal presentation to congressional staffers. That'll happen this year too.

**EDIT**: One vote per person on each entry, please. Things are going great, and duplicate votes just make work for the MIT guys who have to filter them out.

I am an executive with a large US energy company and a 7+ year redditor. AMA.,301,0.96,1r2hbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1r2hbn/i_am_an_executive_with_a_large_us_energy_company/,335,2013-11-21,"NOTE:  This is a throwaway(ish) account that the /r/energy mods validated and will confirm later.

I also chose to be vague about my company.  People in this industry can be *very* passionate about energy beliefs and opinions.  My goal is to simply provide some Q&A from an industry executive view.  I'll do my best to put the facts out there and will point out when I shift to opinions.



I am not an engineer.  My background is on the business side of energy - leading my company's efforts for M&A, investments, strategy, business restructuring and innovation.  I should be able to cover questions around US policies, natural gas, coal, electric utilities, pipelines, environmental impact, coal, adaptation of new technologies, smart grid, energy policy and more.  



AMA!  

**Edit:** Thanks so much for your excellent questions and patience in your explanations.  I'll check back in to pick up any other comments."
