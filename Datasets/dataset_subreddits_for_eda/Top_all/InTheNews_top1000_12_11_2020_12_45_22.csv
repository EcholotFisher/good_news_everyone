**Please try to keep posts on topic and the discussion centered on the facts as they stand. This is not a witch hunt.**

**Ricin Letter man [arrested and unrelated to Boston Bombing](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/04/17/obama-letter-suspicious-subtance.html) so there is no need to talk about it!!** 

**Also aware of the explosion in Texas, although there is nothing that even remotely connects the two incidents so please stop including that in the thread.**

Not news, but [really touching video from the Boston Bruins game tonight](http://video.bruins.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=0&id=240032&cmpid=embed-share-video). I'm a hockey fan so I'm going to add it here for those interested. If I get enough flack for it from ya'll I'll take it down! 

**Update 277** (**22:06 EDT**) So with regards to Hannity(on  fox) and now CNN as well, photos of 2 persons of interest being circulated by FBI. CNN is saying that for the integrity of the case they are not showing the pictures. Fox (local affiliate) is showing a picture of the Blue shirt man with his Black sweatered friend with the white hat. They are easy to find in the comments, but I am not linking them as I believe the picture itself may still be speculation.

Since information is unlikely to arrive at yesterday's pace, please take a moment and check to make sure your sources are reliable before you post breaking news. 

The FBI and BPD will be holding a press conference at **9:30 AM ET** to discuss their investigation. **[A live stream of this event can be viewed at the links here.](http://www.wwhdtv.com/category/country/usa/)**

**Update 171 (8:47 AM ET)** [Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed his condolences and offered his nation's full support in the wake of this terrible tragedy.](http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/5277)

**Update 172 (8:50 AM ET)** User /u/uberalice has offered [4,000 miles with American Airlines](http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1cggwa/boston_marathon_explosions_live_update_thread_6/c9g8sfg) if anyone is in need. In addition, users of /r/Boston have offered significant amounts of airline miles and hotel points to anybody in need.

**Update 173 (9:38 AM ET)** The press conference has begun. You can watch online [here](http://livewire.wcvb.com/Event/117th_Running_of_Boston_Marathon), [here](http://www.wwhdtv.com/watch-msnbc-live-streaming), or on television through most news channels.

**Update 174 (9:41 AM ET)** Confirmation: Aside from the bombs that detonated, all suspicious packages found so far did not contain explosives. A total of two bombs were involved in this attack.

**Update 175 (9:45 AM ET)** The total number of victims injured in these attacks has been confirmed to exceed 150.

**Update 176 (10:00 AM ET)** Since this is an ongoing investigation, official comments on the components of this case are not expected to be forthcoming. I will continue to update as the day goes on, but I would not expect the volume of updates we experienced yesterday.

**Update 177 (10:05 AM ET)** 176 injured is the best estimate of casualties stemming from the blasts, according to investigators. 

**Update 178 (10: AM ET)** The press conference has concluded. It is likely that this press conference has answers for many questions that will be asked in regard to yesterday's news; I urge everyone to find a copy of the conference and watch it before asking questions. /u/TheREDish has posted a [functional transcript of this press conference.](http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1cggwa/boston_marathon_explosions_live_update_thread_6/c9g8o4k)

**Update 179 (10:30 AM ET)** I may be out of line, but I'd like to respect the spirit of this subreddit and ease up on the people who would like to speculate and discuss.

**Update 180 (10:45 AM ET)** Dr. Don Walls, Brigham Chair of Emergency Medicine, has described removing projectiles from several patients. Round, manufactured shrapnel, of similar constitution to a BB, was removed from several patients. Nails (described as carpenter nails) were embedded in several other bodies. 

**Reminder** [Police are insisting that all photos, videos, and information that may help establish a timeline for this attack should be shared with investigators.](https://twitter.com/Boston_Police)

>As a little background as to why any information/photos/videos could be helpful:
I'm not sure if they touched on this, but even if you have only one photo from somewhere in Copley over the course of the day, it could be useful. Those photos and videos can be used in conjunction with store/ATM cameras and traffic cameras as well as additional eye-witness testimony and photographic evidence to create a map of who was at the scene, and where they went. With the amount of coverage the marathon got, it is very likely that the person who placed the device is on camera several times. As an investigator looking at this situation you could perhaps follow somebody by seeing them first on a traffic camera looking suspicious. You could then follow them through several different peoples photos and see where they went and over what time span they went there. You could gather enough evidence to justify putting out BOLOs for specific people needed for questioning.

>If you have ANYTHING; a photo of yourself eating breakfast in Copley, an instagrammed photo of Copley prior to the race beginning, a panorama of the finish line, a picture of your friend or family member as they finish the race... all of it is useful or potentially useful.

**Update 186 (11:53 AM ET)** Thanks once again to everyone who has been so eager to help those in need.

**Update 187 (12:00 PM ET)** I just received this notification from a member of the Boston medical community:

>A Message from the DFCI/BWH Blood Donor Center:

>The tragic events at the Boston Marathon have led to an overwhelming outpouring of support to the Blood Donor Center. If you’re considering donating blood or platelets, the center requests that you call to schedule a blood or platelet donation and consider scheduling your donation in the coming weeks to help us replenish and maintain the supply of blood products to meet the needs of patients at both Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

**Update 188 (12:35 PM ET)** [The Associated Press](https://twitter.com/AP/status/324195093206679552) has reported the following:

>MORE: Explosives at Boston Marathon were in pressure cookers inside duffel bags, a person briefed on probe says.

This is unverifiable information due to the anonymity of the source, but the accuracy of the AP so far leads me to believe they do in fact have a credible inside source. 

**Update 189 (1:00 PM ET)** Foreign Affairs Canada has reported that no Canadian Citizens were injured in the explosions. Thanks to /u/crazyexgirlfriend for this information. 

**Update 190 (2:00 PM ET)** Two of the three fatalities have been named; [29 year old Krystle Campbell and 8 year old Martin Richard.](http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/second-boston-marathon-victim-identified-krystle-campbell-174401374.html) Richard and his family were fleeing from the first blast when the second bomb detonated, killing him.

Hey everyone! After requests to create a live update thread, I will keep this post up to date.

After the Boston Bombings and similar, I ask you to keep speculation to a minimum as to avoid forcing this thread into a read-only page, should things increase.


**Updates**

* **[12:23 pm GMT] Hareetz has quoted the Lebanese Foreign Minister in saying ""Resistance forces will respond to the Israeli aggression… Iran will not allow to Israel destabilize the region."" Whilst residents of the Northern city of Kiryat have been calling in asking about shelters and whether or not classes are still on. It is clear they are concerned but officials are telling the public to trust in their defense force.**

* **[11:39 am GMT] Hareetz is reporting that the the Israeli Fighter Jets fired on the Syrian targets from the airspace above Lebanon, avoiding entering Syrian Airspace.**

* **[11:06 am GMT] Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al Mekdad said on CNN that the attack on the Syrian military facility near Damascus is a 'declaration of war' by Israel. In an interview with CNN correspondent Frederik Pleitgen in Damascus, al Mekdad, an official considered close to President Assad, said the attack is evidence to an alliance between Islamic terrorists and Israel. He added that Syria would choose the time and way of retaliation. Note the similarities that this has with the North Korean sabre rattling - Just an observation.**

* **[9:32 am GMT] The Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu is still scheduled for his visit to China. This is good news.**

* **[9:10 am GMT] Reuters is also reporting Iran condemning the attack (expected) and calling for the region to stand against the action. [Source] (http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/05/us-syria-crisis-iran-idUSBRE94402820130505)**

* **[9:06 am GMT] Reuters is reporting a senior Israeli official on Syria's Chemical Stock pile as ""Not wanted"" by the Hezbollah rebels. This is very good news for the region, instead Hezbollah is after conventional weapon systems. [Source] (http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/04/us-syria-crisis-chemical-israel-idUSBRE94309720130504)**

* [8:59 am GMT] An expansion on the previous update, an IDF official has been quoted as saying ""Iron Dome batteries are deployed from time to time in different locations across the country according to security assessments. The system is currently being deployed in the northern region.""

* [8:48 am GMT] Haaretz is reporting the deployment of two Iron Dome Battery systems (Anti missile systems) near the cities of Haifa and Safed, to address tension along the country's northern border.

* [8:40 am GMT] CNN is saying there are reports of Iraqi Shiites fighting in Syria with Iranian Revolutionary Guards providing intellectual and advisory report. Israels Defense Force has still yet to comment.

* [8:29 am GMT] Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has not commented on the matter at the opening of the cabinet meeting.

* [8:24 am GMT] According to [Haaretz] (http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/live-blog-israel-launches-second-syria-strike-in-three-days-sources-say-1.519250), Israeli forces attacked a weapons and ammunition storehouses and air defense centers, the research facility remains unharmed. They are also quoting Lebanon television as reporting Syrian Air Defense succeeded in hitting an enemy aircraft. This information is from a Hezbollah (Israel's opponents/rebels) and thus is likely to be biased.

* [7:21 am GMT] After talking with /u/NewsCrowd, it is clear there is a slow down in information currently.

* [6:52 am GMT] Reuters is quoting a source in saying the targets are Fateh-110 missiles in transit from Iran to Hezbollah. [Here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fateh-110) is the wiki page on the missile.

* [5:47 am GMT] A few of you are questioning the Iranian presence in the Golans. This is not confirmed and instead is simply there to answer people's questions as the rumors spread. There is no evidence as to Iranian presence in the region and thus cannot be verified or confirmed. Apologies over any mis-communication. It seems only rumor websites in the region are being updated, one source has mentioned the possibility of a media black out. I will keep this updated.

* [5:20 am GMT] Talking with some of my sources, the Israelis contacted are feeling calm about this and are ready to roll, but believe this to blow over quickly as of current. Still no comment from Assad. The previous rumor about an armed convoy has not provided any evidence.

* [5:04 am GMT] Reports that Iranian Military [5:35 am GMT] is possibly (Israeli Radio) on the Syrian side of the Golan Mountain Range - This is unconfirmed and speculative. I am mentioning this to keep track of all information.

* [4:14 am GMT] Thank you to those offering help, this is greatly appreciated. Also check out this [Reddit-Stream] (http://reddit-stream.com/comments/1dpog2/) to stay up to date.

* [4:06 am GMT] BBC World News is talking to a journalist who has said this could be the biggest attack on the Syrian Military in years.

* [4:04 am GMT] Thanks to /u/edwardunknown for more video angles. [One angle] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r0peaesxu4) and [another] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Se5s6C0P38).

* [4:02 am GMT] BBC World News has reported the strike location is also a prime artillery position that a lot of strikes come out of.

* [3:37 am GMT] Assad has yet to officially declare war as [The Commentator] (http://www.thecommentator.com/article/3447/assad_to_declare_war_on_israel_following_fresh_airstrikes) has been reporting.

* [3:21 am GMT] I would like to take the time to address a few rumors. No reports on this 'nuke' that is trending on twitter, the blast would have been larger and the coverage worldwide. There are twitter reports that Syria is sending forces to the Israel/Syria Border - This cannot be confirmed at all. Assad has yet to comment on this, no sites are quoting him on this attack. I would also like to ask people to check the articles they are linking in the news subreddits, quite a few are from the Friday Strike.

* [3:12 am GMT] RT is citing a local journalist reporting 300 people dead and a total of 4 blasts striking the area.

* [3:04 am GMT] The BBC is currently playing a phone interview to a local journalist(?) of people experiencing a minor earthquake before the blast. In his words this could indicate an underground structure being attacked. This is not confirmed - Just the latest on BBC news.

* [3:02 am GMT] Reports coming in of multiple casualties as expected.

* [3:01 am GMT] The BBC is reporting multiple attacks on local military bases, stating locals as sources.

* [2:59 am GMT] [Here] (http://i.imgur.com/k1VROAP.jpg) is a resource on where the strikes have occurred provided by /u/crybabypeepants.

* [2:54 am GMT] It was pointed out to me the ABC link I have linked to is on the Friday Attack - The information about the missile strike is only valid about the Friday strike. Today's strike is against the military research center. Apologies over any confusion. Thank you Lt-Derp.

**The Story so far** [2:47 am GMT]

* An Israeli Air Strike has hit a Missile shipment headed towards Hezbollah.

* The strike itself occurred near a Ammunition depot and Military Research Center.

* The missiles are being reported to be 'game changing' and include ground to ground missiles. **This is from an ABC article that I was linked to addressing the Friday Strike. Today's target is the Military Research Center. No reports of other targets. Apologies over confusion caused.**

* The White House is transferring all questions to the Israeli Embassy.

* A lot of speculation on possible war between the two countries - No official word as of yet.

* Assad has yet to address this attack.

His name has been trending for the past 4 hours. 

Many posts and tweets have been calling for his death or pain on his family.


We did this.


Maybe we didn't mean to, or even want to, but we did. 


The downside of instant journalism is that we sometimes get things wrong. And sometimes media outlets can take this false information and run with it.



Hours before the media blitz and craziness of this night posts in /r/FindBostonBombers called Sunil out by name, speculating that he was involved. Even if the circumstances were too coincidental to ignore, what's the benefit of posting his name and picture to an online community instead of discretely calling the FBI?



When did imaginary internet points become more important than helping an investigation, or not jumping to conclusions and causing a witch hunt?



The point is, this family has suffered far too much. Well before we as a community stuck our ugly neck beards in their business.



Reddit, we owe them.

**EDIT:** The supposed originator of the Suspect 2/Sunil comparison photo has apologized on Twitter. Hopefully more media outlets will follow suit.



**EDIT 2:** [Sunil's family posted this on Facebook a few minutes ago](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=417287098368653&amp;amp;l=55bda423e6)

>A tremendous and painful amount of attention has been cast on our beloved Sunil Tripathi in the past twelve hours.

>We have known unequivocally all along that neither individual suspected as responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings was Sunil.

>We are grateful to all of you who have followed us on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit—supporting us over the recent hours.

Hey everyone - As per requests from users, I have migrated the coverage to this live thread. I will be updating this post with the latest information and trying to keep everyone up to date. 

***

**Updates**

***

* [7:05 pm GMT+1] There is a fire burning towards the avenue - Protesters claim cops in civilian clothing have set these but naturally this is unconfirmed. 

***

* [7:00 pm GMT+1] Reports coming in that the crowd have medical students mixed in who happen to be prepared for the gas. They have gas masks and home made remedies to counter act the spray. This has seemingly slowed the police down. Reports that the Taksim military hospital is handing out gas masks to the protesters. It's 6:00 am here, so I'll be heading to bed in a few. G'Night all!

***

* [6:40 pm GMT+1] [This] (http://www.ustream.tv/channel/emekdunyasitv) live thread is showing a woman with a bad head injury, they're trying to get her to the hospital/ambulance but she has been put in a car to get her on the move. Ambulances are not available for the protesters due to their unrest and disobedience (According to officials - Luckily some people have humanity.

***

* [6:35 pm GMT+1] The large crowd in Istanbul has been separated into three groups with the police planning charges to drive the protesters back. Reports suggest the 3g has been disconnected, although residents are opening up their wifi's to allow communication to continue. Rumors are also suggesting that the Chief of Police may have been asked to step down - This is unconfirmed.

***

* [6:20 pm GMT+1] [Over 10,000 people are thought to be protesting] (https://twitter.com/venimu/status/340513920592789504/photo/1) in Izmir. 

***

* [6:11 pm GMT+1] Mainstream media is beginning to pick up on the event, although is not providing live coverage. BBC just provided a piece on the protest, even reporting about the Egyptian tourist struck by a gas canister. [The mayor of Kadikoy has been called upon to send Ambulances to the protesters - No word on the level of injury] (https://twitter.com/12numaraorg/status/340506965576929281/photo/1).

***

* [6:02 pm GMT+1] Protesters in other cities have gathered at their respective cities parks to protest. [This is in Eskisehir Kent Park] (https://twitter.com/smtsln/status/340506577603788802/photo/1), whilst [this is in Ankara at the Kugulu Park] (https://twitter.com/gokcebugra/status/340500540159033347/photo/1). Finally [This is Izmir] (https://twitter.com/elifimgazelim/status/340503244038094848/photo/1). Protests around the country are kicking off.

***

* [5:55 pm GMT+1] Reported groups from Karsiyaka and Goztepe to join in the protests in Istanbul. Another confirmed protest in Eskisehir, west of Ankara. [Here] (http://tks.ibb.gov.tr/noc-player.php?id=17&w=600&h=338) is a live security camera from the avenue.

***

* [5:48 pm GMT+1] [Here] (http://imgur.com/a/m6HZU#26EyCE1) is an album from someone in the crowd currently. He is reporting live in the [IRC chat] (https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/news?settings=dd892af474749b032ba39bb88a8894d9) - If you do join, please keep the channel free when required as to allow me to gather updates quickly.

***

* [5:43 pm GMT+1] Another source on the ground has suggested major football clubs who normally hold a bitter rivalry have moved in together to force the police back and support those who are exposed and defenseless. There is a large column of people in Istanbul which the police are aiming to divide and gas. 

***

* [5:35 pm GMT+1] Talking to someone on the ground in Istanbul - He has unconfirmed reports that the Government has shut down the only agency reporting on the rioting whilst warning the other agencies not to report or the same will happen to them. Protesters are using black paint against the gas masks of police as to force them to take them off and be exposed to the spray.

***

* [5:27 pm GMT+1] Twitter is showing a high number of retweets in support for a German sit-in, in support of the plight with the Turks.

***

* [5:22 pm GMT+1] /u/barbellfag claims a friend of his has died during the riots, the death has been confirmed by family. This is a unconfirmed claim.

***

* [5:16 pm GMT+1] **Breaking** - Massive crowds as shown by [this album] (http://imgur.com/a/OkJSm) and [this livesteam] (http://www.ustream.tv/channel/okanbay%C3%BClgenfm?utm_campaign=t.co&utm_source=14575601&utm_medium=social) have taken to the Istiklal Avenue in Istanbul. Thanks to /u/douglasmacarthur and /u/odinsbrotherinlaw

***

* [5:13 pm GMT+1] [A collage of riot images] (https://twitter.com/hsyinblt/status/340496036390912000/photo/1) show the extent of which the police are going to as to remove the unrest from the streets. BBC UK is reporting people hospitalized due to respiratory illnesses caused by the tear gas and pepper spray. 

***

* [5:10 pm GMT+1] The large amount of cameras and journalists suggest a large media presence, yet the lack of coverage suggests otherwise. Another good point raised by a resident - The park is where people gather after earthquakes, if it was removed, we would only have the street where we can be hurt. A very good point in terms of public safety.

***

* [5:07 pm GMT+1] Reports of traffic cameras being shutdown in the protest areas - Some businesses and homes are opening up their wifi to protesters as to allow communication and export of footage/images of the situation. Finally there are tweets from people saying they are trapped by police and cannot move without having tear gas fired upon them - [Here is a tweet in question] (https://twitter.com/girlaboutalot/status/340499392127696898/photo/1)

***

* [5:05 pm GMT+1] [This] (http://www.dha.com.tr/canli-yayin/) site is showing footage (Not sure if live) of riots, in which the activists are building a wall of material between themselves and the police. 

***

* [5:01 pm GMT+1] It is just past 7:00 pm in Turkey - The time in which many crowds are set to gather in population centers across the country. [Here] (http://erkansaka.net/archives/22982) is a site for a view on the more peaceful parts of the protests.

***

* [4:55 pm GMT+1] Reports coming in of large crowds in Izmir - [This photo] (https://twitter.com/izmirajanda/status/340494052527058945/photo/1) shows a crowd forming outside of the pier. If this is any sign of what's to come, we'll be in for a long night.

***

* [4:48 pm GMT+1] [A New Imgur Album] (http://imgur.com/a/1S08D) shows a collection of images and the story behind them of events from the protests, well worth a look at before the news picks up again.

***

* [4:37 pm GMT+1] It is currently 6:37 pm in Turkey, with many of the planned protests beginning at 7:00 pm. Over the next hour or so, it is likely we will see a large number of people showing their opposition to current policies and political figures.

***

* [4:33 pm GMT+1] [The picture] (https://twitter.com/mirkoschaefer/status/340446801981214722/photo/1) that currently stands as the image that represents the protests has gone viral. A woman stands against the pepper spray of a riot policeman. 

***

* [4:23 pm GMT+1] A [new] (https://twitter.com/popartbiziandy/status/340476961388367872/photo/1) photo shows a suggested combat plan to the water cannons that have been controlling the crowds. [Here] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm0VKv2C2TA) is the next update video. 

***

* [4:17 pm GMT+1] Unconfirmed twitter reports that the police have issued a widespread arrest warrant for anyone wearing a gas mask. This would obviously change the landscape of this protest hugely, giving the protesters the option between getting arrested or being peppersprayed/gassed. 

***

* [4:14 pm GMT+1] [OccupyGezi.tumblr] (http://occupygezipics.tumblr.com/) is showing a brand new pic of a bloodied man being tended to in shelter. [This] (https://twitter.com/aycaorer/status/340477522309419009/photo/1) photo shows police clearing a street of protesters.

***

* [4:08 pm GMT+1] The latest waves of vocal twitter opinion is now questioning the media and how they cannot cover this event when it is happening in the most populous city in the country. The situation in Turkey is seemingly worse than previous thought.

***

* [4:05 pm GMT+1] WARNING - GORE: A [new photo] (https://twitter.com/dilantoplu/status/340483621561454592/photo/1) has surfaced showing a woman on a stretcher, inside an ambulance with a bloody head wound. No information on how she received the wound - From previous images of injuries, it would not surprise me personally if the injury was sustained from a head shot from a gas canister.

*** 

* [4:01 pm GMT+1] Reports that the Health Minister has said ""You cannot protest and expect an ambulance."" - Reports that Amnesty International is beginning to mobilize members to help provide attention to the situation.

***

* [3:51 pm GMT+1] NewsBreaker has just tweeted [this photo] (https://twitter.com/CanYayinlari/status/340477667054858242/photo/1) out - Not sure on how genuine it is considering the time (5:51 pm)

***

* [3:47 pm GMT+1] Twitter feeds are suggesting hidden numbers of severe injuries, much larger than the 'minor injury' toll a doctor gave Reuters earlier. The situation is apparently much worse than what we are currently seeing - Wishing them the best.

***

* [3:44 pm GMT+1] Increased support from international sources - #OccupyGezi is now trending with many chiming in with their thoughts on the situation. Many more young turks are out on the streets tonight trying to make their voices heard - Their choice of tool being twitter.

***

* [3:41 pm GMT+1] Reported kissing protests for Istanbul and Ankara are just a few ways the activists are acting out against the government. The Prime Minister does not hide the fact he will be running for President when his current role expires, making the opposition fearful of his power.

***

**Details**

***

The event itself is a peaceful sit in, protesting the demolition of the 'last green space' in Istanbul. The protest is now in it's fourth day with protesters calling on social media to get the story out due to the heavy control the government holds on the mainstream media. 

There has been countless reports and claims of police brutality, even going so far as closing the metro gates after firing tear gas canisters into the area. One woman who was able to get on the radio found trouble breathing and was in great discomfort. 

Amnesty international is reporting 'the use of excessive force' by police, in their response to the sit in. It should be noted however, that the park is one of many issues this protest has grown to cover. Many protesters have joined in to respond to new laws threatening 'liberal lifestyles' such as a reduced tolerance of public affection and further limiting alcohol laws. Some are even protesting the handling of the situation in neighboring Syria.

Some are concerned that this could be Turkey's Arab Spring Protest, bringing the three term party of Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan to an end. The Prime Minister has jailed hundreds of military officers, academics, journalists etc jailed and put on trial for alleged failed coups. 

The current situation involves 10,000's of protesters with the potential for this unrest to spread further. This poses a danger to those who have been inadvertently caught up in the event.

**TL;DR:** Hundreds of people were likely injured in a fiery explosion on Wednesday night at a fertilizer plant near Waco, Texas, that damaged or destroyed numerous buildings including a school and nursing home, authorities said. The blast was reported at about 8 p.m. CDT (0100 GMT on Thursday) in West, a town of some 2,700 people about 80 miles south of Dallas and 20 miles north of Waco. All times listed below are CST, as per my location. I apologize if this causes any confusion. Town of West Evacuated, all injuries are now at area hospitals.  Fire and PD dealing with flareups, doing another House-by-House search. Many local assisting fire departments from neighboring counties have been cleared and sent back to their districts. Other anhydrous tanks on site are reported to be stable for the moment. The Rest Haven nursing home has been damaged. 150 survivors from the nursing home have been taken to the West community center.

**UPDATES** (Times in CDT)

**2:42** Eyewitnesses have reported a dark curtain of soot and dust covering the area, with debris lying across roads, buildings destroyed and several fires still raging.

**2:47** @youranonnews: Fires at the plant are now under control and the threat of further explosion has been downgraded.

**2:53** The fertilizer plant where the explosion occurred was [cited for failing to obtain or to qualify for a permit in 2006.](http://www.khou.com/home/Fertilizer-plant-cited-for-06-permit-violation--203542181.html)

**4:03**  The town of West's mayor Tommy Muska: ""This is not the end of the world. This is a big ol' cut that we got across our hearts right now. But... we are strong. We will rebuild.""

**4:32** WFAA just spoke to Dr. Smith (West EMS Director) live, and he **confirmed the deaths of at least 2 EMS workers.**

**4:41** An emergency crew spokesman has now confirmed that there were no fatalities at a nursing home badly damaged in the blast. The home is close to the plant, and all residents were evacuated in the immediate aftermath of the incident. It is understood that 10 residents of the home were initially reported missing, but they have since been accounted for.

**4:46** Three hospitals are dealing with nearly 200 injuries. Several firefighters that were fighting the fire when the blast occurred remain missing, as does a law enforcement official. 

**BREAKING** The death toll is estimated to be between **5 and 15** at this stage. 

**4:49** Police said they had labelled the incident a crime scene, but they have ""heard no indication that it was anything other than an accidental fire"". Because crime scene investigators have not yet been able to get inside the plant, there is so far no information about how the fire started. Smoldering fires continue in the plant, and in buildings surrounding it, so the search operation is in some cases a slow process. Emergency crews will work their way through ""every individual home"" to check whether any casualties are inside. Police confirmed the smoke from the fire is not believed to be harmful. City officials will give further details on the latest situation at **10am** local time.

**5:01** **BREAKING/UNCONFIRMED** A spokesman for ambulance teams on scene told CBS that **two paramedics and six firefighters had been killed.** In addition, **one person** in an apartment block destroyed in the blast also died.

**5:05** Police said the air quality in the area is ""not an issue, it is not a concern"".

**5:22** Belgian news channel is seeking a french speaker to talk to them about the explosion. If anyone here on reddit can help with this, please contact 0032 2 737 40 32 or infos@rtbf.be.

**5:44** No nursing home residents were killed, and all have been accounted for and they are moved to a safe place.

**5:52** @WacoPolice: Area law enforcement, fire, first responders,etc. continue search and rescue ops. 160+ injured, numerous homes destroyed.  |   Missing Persons Number: **254-826-4115**

191,791: official COVID deaths as of 9/11/2020

It will be wrong later today...

64 x “September 11” level events since February...

We have a “September 11” level event \~2-3 days now...

After 9/11, we fought wars; we changed policy; we gave up freedoms of privacy and detainment; we even take off shoes and restrict liquids at the airport...

Today >1000 American deaths a day is “normal” and we should get back to our lives. We are forcing kids/teachers back to school.

Where is the policy change? Where is the action? Some Americans will not even wear a mask, because it’s not “freedom”! What are we doing? Where is the outcry?

So as you post your September 11 - Never Forgets today, think about 64x. American lives are American lives, right?

But it’s ok to lie to American people right? Preventing panic right? Sorry 64x. I will not listen to your ignorant anger no more! Numbers and facts only. It’s time for panic. It’s time for drastic change.

It is time to stand up for the 64x.

(Disclaimer: All loss of American life whether terrorism or a pandemic is unacceptable... that’s the point) #COVID19 #PatriotDay #september11 #neverforget #64x"

"Saudi Arabian Prince, Former Ambassador to United States, and Close Personal Friend to President George W. Bush Orchestrated and Funded 9/11 Terror Attacks",270,0.95,4tgvtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/4tgvtz/saudi_arabian_prince_former_ambassador_to_united/,31,2016-7-19,"Because the [Document](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/15/read-declassified-files-from-911-inquiry.html) is hard to read and the article doesn't get to the important points.

For the Lazy:

**Saudi Arabian Prince, Former Ambassador to United States, and Close Personal Friend to President George W. Bush Orchestrated and Funded 9/11 Terror Attacks**

**Things we knew already:**

 * Bandar (Saudi prince) had close relationships with both of the Bush presidents to the point that he was often described as a member of the former president’s family. George Bush gave him the nickname ""Bandar Bush""

 * Bandar was a very strong advocate for Saddam Hussein’s overthrow in Iraq

**According to journalist Bob Woodward, verified by 60 minutes.**

 * 5 days after 9/11 George bush says while he had to do Afghanistan first, he was determined to do something about saddam Hussein.

 * George Bush quote referring to 9/11: “this is an opportunity to take out saddam Hussein perhaps” “What have you got in terms of plans for Iraq? What is the status of the war plan? I want you to get on it. I want you to keep it a secret.”

 * Prince Bandar was told about the invasion of Iraq two days before the secretary of state.

 * Prince Bandar promised George Bush to lower Saudi oil prices in the months before Bush’s 2004 election to ensure the US economy was strong on election day.

 * Bush didn’t ask any key cabinet members about whether they should go to war in Iraq

**New things we learned today**

 * Bandar was linked to a senior al Qaida operative that was captured in Iraq

 * Bandar and his wife paid Bassman, Bassman’s wife, Al-Bayoumi and al Bayoumi’s wife large sums of money in the time period surrounding 9/11.

 * Al-Bayoumi let the hijackers stay in his apartment, helped them find housing in the US, Co-signed their lease, paid their rent, helped them get into flight school.

 * Al Bayoumi’s monthly “allowances” pay went from 475 to 3700 after the hijackers arrived in the US. It went back down again the same month the hijackers left San Diego (where Bayoumi was based)

 * Al-Bayoumi had close ties to the Saudi government, was paid a monthly salary by the ministry of defense through 9/11

 * Al-Bayoumi frequently contacted the Saudi embassy in DC while Bandar was the ambassador’

 * After staying with Al Bayoumi, two hijackers lived with an FBI informant

 * Bassman, an alleged Saudi agent friend of al Bayoumi’s lived directly across from and was in touch with two hijackers.

 * Bassman’s wife received 70,000 from Bandar’s wife for “nursing services”. She never used any nursing services.
 
 * Bassman received 15,000 directly from Bandar, his wife also received 10,000

**Logic:**

 * George Bush had to have known about this damning evidence regarding his friend that turned out to be a terrorist before invading Iraq because he was given this very report in 2002. However the information was kept a secret from the American public until just now. Still nothing is being done about the man who we've had hard evidence orchestrated and funded a terror attack that killed upwards of 3000 innocent Americans. 

 * George Bush had an extremely close relationship with Bandar. Bandar simultaneously was giving 5 figure sums of money to the people that plotted 9/11 and lived with the hijackers. Either Bush was getting duped by this man who he considered to be a good friend, or Bush had knowledge of what was going on.

 * Bush and Bandar both had something to gain from war in Iraq.

 * 9/11 made war in Iraq seem more logical in the eyes of the public. George bush himself called 9/11 an **opportunity** to take out Saddam Hussein.
 
**Other Misc Facts:**

 * On the day of 9/11 George Bush, and much of the rest of the chain of command for responding to domestic threats didn’t come into work.
 
 * The US air defense system didn’t follow procedures for diverted passenger flights.

 * The US was warned about an attack in detail beforehand, did nothing

 * A lot of prominent people that should have been in the WTC that day avoided it including Bush’s cousin who had a conference that was moved across the street at the last minute

>""Andrew Kitzenburg, 29, said he looked out of this third floor window to see two young men of slight build in jackets shooting at dozens of police officers from behind a black Mercedes SUV. The officers and the men were 70 yards apart, he said, and engaged in “constant gunfire.” A police SUV “drove towards the shooters,” he said, and was shot at until it was severely damaged. It rolled out of control, Mr. Kitzenberg said, and crashed into two cars in his driveway. The two shooters, he said, had a large and unwieldy bomb. “They lit it, still in the middle of the gunfire, and threw it. But it went 20 yards at most.” It exploded, he said, and one of the two men ran towards the gathered police officers. He was tackled, but it was not clear if he was shot, Mr. Kitzenberg said.""

**11:07** The full statement from President Obama earlier this morning can be read in full [HERE](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/04/18/statement-president-explosion-west-texas)

**11:29** Texas Task Force 1 (TX-TF1) was activated just before 1:00 am this morning by the Governor through the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) and deployed from their facility in College Station to West, Texas around 6:00 am to assist the jurisdiction in search and rescue operations after a large explosion at a fertilizer plant. The 80 member TX-TF1 “Red” Team is a Type 1 Urban Search & Rescue (US&R) Team consisting of Technical and Canine Search components along with Heavy Rescue personnel and equipment. Upon arrival, TX-TF1 will receive assignments from the local Incident Command and assist the jurisdiction as needed while setting up a Base of Operations (BoO) to continue the mission as long as necessary. via /u/rangerrick9211

**11:31** Latest Presser [HERE](http://dfw.cbslocal.com/video/8787720-1000am-update-from-west/) from 1 hour ago.

**11:32** From 10:00 AM Presser - Sheriff Spokesman - 160+ Injuries treated, anywhere from 5 to 15 Dead so far (not confirmed on # of dead), Search and Rescue are still going on in ""continuation mode"". State and Fed SAR resources are with them, including Texas TF1 & TF2, Burleson FD SAR, and Ft. Hood SAR. Many areas searching are having to be stabilized and shored up with heavy equipment before they can access the structures to search. It is tedious, time-consuming, but they are being very methodical in order to make sure lives are safe. As buildings are cleared, they are being marked as clear. There has been only 1 incident of looting, from very early in the situation - it has been dealt with, and the neighborhoods are completely secured currently.

**11:40** More info from Presser - Officials from the company are on site assisting with operations, but no statement is expected soon as they are quite busy. 24 minutes elapsed from initial fire call to explosion. Injuries and bodies were taken first to a ball field for triage, then moved to a community center when the cloud of anhydrous forced them to move.  State Fire Marshalls are on site and investigating cause of fire. Officials say no worries about environmental dangers in aftermath of #westtx explosion, thanks largely to wind and rain. Evacuees can NOT yet access their homes at this time.

**11:47** Sheriff's Dept Rep: Damage is widespread and severe. There are homes and buildings that are no longer there, for all practical purposes. There is nothing to indicate that this was intentional. ATF and State Fire Marshalls are investigating the cause of the fire.

**11:51** Gov. Rick Perry Press Conference live NOW [Here](http://www.breakingnews.com/topic/texas-fertilizer-plant-explosion-april-2013)

**11:55**  From Governor's Press Conference: At this time, we have no ""unmet needs"" in West at this time, and thank the other communities who have helped. The TX legislature is prepared to do anything needed to help West move forward from this incident, Our Prayers go out to them. If there are questions about missing family members, the Red Cross is point of access, please call **211.**

**12:00** There has not been a complaint on the fertilizer plant since 2006. The facility has been there since 1962. About 75 Homes have either minor to substantial damage. A school also has a substantial amount of damage. The number of employees at the plant is not known at this time. Gas pipelines being monitored, gas turned off to homes in the area.

**12:07** Cannot speculate on cause of explosion, and cannot say whether water used in the fire caused the ammonium nitrate to kick off,  Firefighters use water to cool the tanks in situations frequently. Keep an eye on the Governor's website for information on charitable opportunities to help those in West.

**2:12** Among the missing are a Dallas Fire Captain who lives in West, it was unknown if he was assisting with the West fire. Also missing is Navarro Mills Volunteer Firefighter: Perry Calvin.

**3:32** New Press Conference [HERE](http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nbcnews.com/51587393)

**3:36** From Presser: Price Gouging rules activated in Texas. Anyone attempting to price gouge will be facing a lawsuit from the TX Atty. General.  TX DPS reports: they are still in SAR phase, looking for anyone still in rubble. For Security reasons, ATF has requested that nobody enter the affected areas.  The old library has been opened as a community assistance building for residents of West. A post office has also been opened for the residents.  Perishable items are not needed, please donate money to red cross instead.  Exact number of fatalities is not known. Cannot confirm mayor's statement of 30-40. Will not speak on issues regarding possible criminal negligence by the plant.  

**3:42** From Presser: Chief Deputy Sheriff reports: area is devastated, they are working with ATF and Fire Marshalls to determine cause. The investigation is volatile because of the presence of Ammonia at the site. EPA and TX Environmental are looking at the scene to determine the safety situation. Cannot speak about missing firefighters.   From Texas AG: Will not confirm numbers of missing firefighters at this time. Another press conference at 6 PM tonight.

**3:55** In response to the devastation in West, Texas, CBS 11, TXA 21 and CBS RADIO Dallas-Fort Worth stations NewsRadio 1080 KRLD, 98.7 KLUV, 100.3 Jack FM, 103.7 Lite FM, 105.3 The Fan and Mega 107.5 FM are partnering with Albertson’s Market and The Dallas Cowboys to support The Salvation Army’s disaster relief efforts. Those who wish to donate may do so today between 4 and 6:30 p.m. by calling 1-877-TEXAS-11. Representatives from The Salvation Army will be at the CBS 11 and TXA 21 studios in Fort Worth to take those calls. Monetary donations will also be accepted at the registers at all Dallas-Fort Worth Area Albertson’s Market stores.

**3:55** While not official (we consider ""official"" based upon what is posted by USFA/NFFF) - details from reliable and involved fire service leadership at the scene in West, Texas (20 miles north of Waco) are indicating that, at this time it appears that: 5 West Firefighters, 4 EMS Medics, 1 Off Duty Fire Captain from Dallas (who was in town at the time and was assisting) and 1 unconfirmed (unknown agency at this point) Firefighter have been killed in the Line of Duty. Active search and rescue operations are continuing. **Dallas Captain Kenny ""Luckey"" Harris reported deceased by family.**
