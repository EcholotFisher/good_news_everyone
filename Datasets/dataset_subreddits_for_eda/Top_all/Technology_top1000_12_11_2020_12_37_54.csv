Comcast is trying to censor our pro-net neutrality website that calls for an investigation into fake FCC comments potentially funded by the cable lobby,114344,0.93,6cvg82,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/,2496,2017-5-23,"Fight for the Future has received [a cease and desist order](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ) from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) - a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign possibly funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s ""valuable intellectual property."" The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control.

The notice is ironic, in that it’s a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content. 

**If the FCC’s current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.**

The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)

[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.

Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.

Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.

There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. "

Once the FCC announces a vote (which would likely be at its open meeting in December), it will become much, much harder to stop them from gutting the rules that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T from charging us all extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling, blocking, and censoring websites, apps, games, and streaming services. 

The good news is that we are hearing from people who are meeting with Congress that there are key lawmakers who are sympathetic to the cause, and considering stepping in to slow down the FCC. **But they need to be getting a lot more phone calls from constituents in order to act.**

The groups behind the big Net Neutrality [day of action](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) that happened back on July 12 are calling on all Internet users, websites, apps, subreddits, and online communities to do everything they can to drive as many phone calls to Congress as possible between now and November 22.

"We need to make it clear to the FCC that we want uncapped Internet access, for innovation in an increasingly data dependent world and user protection.",71440,0.92,5749a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5749a8/we_need_to_make_it_clear_to_the_fcc_that_we_want/,2438,2016-10-12,"Comcast's data cap policy is a flawed consumer control measure against those who would go without cable and a direct action against companies that have actually innovated over the past decade rather than sit pretty on a monopoly. 

**Why this is flawed:**


**There is no guarantee of accuracy or transparency:**

Regardless of your stance on the matter there should be no argument that internet usage amounts should be accurate and transparent to users affected by it. However that is not the case at all, there is no third party government agency in charge of regulating broadband metering. Comcast contracts out its metering to a third party vendor and its methods of measurement are internal and not open to the public at all. Just this year alone Comcast has received [thirteen thousand complaints about their data caps and their terrible accuracy in measurement](https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/The-FCC-Has-Received-13000-Complaints-About-Comcast-Data-Caps-135895).  Almost everyone who has to deal with this caps seems to have a story of their ISP charging them for data usage that would be impossible given their current bandwidth. 

**Discourages cord cutting and stifles competition:** 

Data caps exist solely as a consumer control measure to stifle competition and cause users to be biased against applications based on the data amount they use. For example [Netflix which lists high quality HD as using 3 GB per hour and Ultra HD as using 7gb per hour](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) is immediately affected by this. As Ultra HD becomes more common and using 7gb of data for an hour of video streaming becomes common place users affected by data caps will hit their limits more easily causing them to be charged overages. This will cause users to drop Netflix in favor of less data intensive services which Comcast will only be too happy to provide through cable. Families of five living in a home with heavy Netflix usage will already be pushing this current limit.

This isn't just for videos of course, people who use services like Steam will be hit just as hard especially as the size of games increases, data intensive services that would have otherwise been developed will languish on the vine as data caps cause consumers to be biased against them.  

**Users have little choice in what ISP they must subscribe to:**

The Internet is no longer a luxury that most can live without. For many it has become an essential utility much like electricity.

In any thread regarding complaints against Comcast or any ISP for that matter the main complaint of users is that they have no choice in their ISP (""Save us Google Fiber!""). Those lucky enough to live in major metropolitan areas may be fortunate enough to have the choice of maybe two or more ISPs but for many users the local ISP is the only choice they have which grants that business a monopoly in their area. In a happier world there would be dozens of ISPs each competing with each other and vying for market share so the poor behavior of one company only provides an opportunity for another to gain more customers. Sadly most Americans don't live in that kind of free economic environment. 


**What we need to do:**

How do consumers collectively fight this when they have little recourse in their choice of ISP?
The FCC is currently investigating data caps as a practice. If we as consumers just accept data caps the FCC will have less reason to crack down so it is imperative that the public puts pressure on the FCC. We're back to the Net Neutrality fight all over again as data caps are just a proxy issue that allows Comcast to achieve the same thing it wanted with its draconian net neutrality rules. 

Some users may be currently exempt from data caps but this behavior will absolutely roll down hill to other ISPs once they realize that consumers will accept it. Then you'll have to deal with your own little small town version of Comcast with little recourse. 

Much like the behavior of the last Net Neutrality fight calling the FCC directly has a huge impact. 

FCC Complaint Line:1-888-225-5322

[If you can't call directly you can file an online form to register your complaint.](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824)

Like before we need to raise public awareness of this issue and flood the FCC with our complaints and input so we don't have to deal with a stifled internet. 

**EDIT 1:**
Some users have mentioned that the online forum and phone line isn't working out for them.
Another number that you can use to submit a comment or complaint.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler: (202) 418-1000

This was also a number we used to contact in order to urge Tom Wheeler to stand for Net Neutrality once again we can call and urge Mr. Wheeler to stand with the internet once again. However please remember that there are real people on the other side of the line. 



**EDIT 2:**

**If you so choose to give the office of Tom Wheeler((202) 418-1000) or the FCC complaint line(1-888-225-5322) a call here's a handy script you can use. Feel free to add on or improvise on this:**

""I'm calling FCC Chairman Wheeler to urge him to stand with Internet users and pass strong, loophole-free rules against so called Data Caps. There is no legitimate, technical reason for these data caps. Comcast itself [admitted](https://gizmodo.com/comcast-will-cap-more-peoples-data-because-of-fairness-1740913276) in [internal customer service guidelines that these caps aren’t about network congestion](https://i.imgur.com/quf68FC.jpg). Instead, it claims these data caps are about “fairness,” but the broadband industry continues to see higher revenues and profits with lower costs overall and there’s no argument that these caps are based on any “fair” costs that Internet usage causes. The real reason behind these caps is to protect Comcast’s monopoly over cable TV, making it more expensive for customers to “cut the cord” even if they want to choose other video options. And by exempting only its own online video application from the cap, Comcast gives Stream TV an advantage over all competing online video applications. ""

Replace Comcast with your own local ISP or ISPs in general.

**EDIT 3:**

The key to this fight will sadly not be a single set of calls made to the FCC but rather a sustained campaign of public pressure and complaint. Long after this thread's karma decays and it falls off the pages people still need let their voices be heard. There will be more threads in the future to bring attention to this we wont go down without a fight.

Eight members of Congress that voted to kill broadband privacy are now leading the charge to kill Net Neutrality as well,70003,0.89,6e8wta,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/,2241,2017-5-31,"FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. 
 
We can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai’s plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. 
 
Here’s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing.  
 
They’re hoping we don’t notice and that they won’t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.
 
Here are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai’s attack on net neutrality:
 
* Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)  (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730)
* Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)  (Twitter: [@MarshaBlackburn](https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn); phone: 202-225-2811)

* Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH)  (Twitter: [@BobLatta](https://twitter.com/boblatta); phone: 202-225-6405)
 
All of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)
 
**Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai’s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** 
 
We can’t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai’s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it’s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai’s plan. It’s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.

EDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn’t an explicit endorsement of Pai’s plan at the FCC, it’s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too.

The so-called CLOUD Act would hand police departments in the U.S. and other countries new powers to directly collect data from tech companies instead of requiring them to first get a warrant.

Reject the anti-encryption bill. These Senators are trying to damage privacy & security while everyone is distracted with Coronavirus! EFF made this easy tool so you can tell your senators.,67825,0.96,fkzfzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/fkzfzq/reject_the_antiencryption_bill_these_senators_are/,1071,2020-3-19,"[**Link to EFF's easy tool to tell your senators.**](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

While  the media and people are distracted with COVID-19, two Senators have  been sneaking through an attack on privacy and online security.

Imagine an Internet where the law required every message sent to be  read by government-approved scanning software. Companies that handle  such messages wouldn’t be allowed to securely encrypt them, or they’d  lose  legal protections that allow them to operate.

[Take Action](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

That’s what the Senate Judiciary Committee has proposed and hopes to pass into law. The [so-called EARN IT bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text), sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), will [strip Section 230 protections](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/graham-blumenthal-bill-attack-online-speech-and-security)   away from any website that doesn’t follow a list of “best practices,”   meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy. The “best practices” list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney   General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban   encryption, and guarantee law enforcement “legal access” to any digital message. This is the next FOSTA - which was disaster for many users and small companies.

The EARN IT bill had  its first hearing March 12th, and its supporters’  strategy is clear. Because  they didn’t put the word “encryption” in the bill, they’re going to  insist it doesn’t affect encryption.

“This  bill says nothing about encryption,” co-sponsor Sen. Blumenthal said  at today’s hearing. “Have you found a word in this bill about encryption?” he asked one witness.

It’s  true that the bill’s authors avoided using that word. But they did propose legislation that enables an all-out assault on encryption.  It would create a 19-person commission that’s completely controlled by  the  Attorney General and law enforcement agencies. And, at the hearing, a Vice-President at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) made it clear \[[PDF](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Shehan%20Testimony.pdf)\]   what he wants the best practices to be. NCMEC believes online services should be made to screen their messages for material that NCMEC considers abusive; use screening technology approved by NCMEC and law   enforcement; report what they find in the messages to NCMEC; and be held legally responsible for the content of messages sent by others.

You can’t have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can [create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/there-no-middle-ground-encryption). The two are mutually exclusive. Concepts like “client-side scanning” aren’t a clever route around this; such scanning is [just another way to break end-to-end encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption). Either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it’s available to others.

The  19-person draft commission isn’t any better than the 15-person commission envisioned in an early draft of the bill. It’s completely dominated by law enforcement and allied groups like NCMEC. Not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives Attorney General Barr the power to veto or approve the list of   best practices. Even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, Barr’s veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them.

The Commission won’t be a  body that seriously considers policy; it  will be a vehicle for creating  a law enforcement wish list. Barr has  made clear, [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/doj-and-fbi-show-no-signs-correcting-past-untruths-their-new-attacks-encryption) and [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/fancy-new-terms-same-old-backdoors-encryption-debate-2019) again, that breaking encryption is at the top of that wish list. Once   it’s broken, authoritarian regimes around the world will rejoice, as   they have the ability to add their own types of mandatory scanning, not   just for child sexual abuse material but for self-expression that those   governments want to suppress. 

The  privacy and security of all users will suffer if U.S. law  enforcement  is able to achieve its dream of breaking encryption.  Senators should  reject the EARN IT bill.

Self Explanatory. Aside from the fact that we pay per MB, and already share a slow connection, if a forced upgrade happened and crashed our pc's while in the middle of coordinating rangers under fire from armed militarized poachers.. blood could literally be on MS's hands. I just came here recently to act as their pilot.. but have IT skills as well. The guy who set these pc's up didn't know how to prevent it, or set a metered connection. I am completely livid.

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apcmtf/reddit_users_rally_against_chinese_censorship/

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apgfu6/winnie_the_pooh_takes_over_reddit_due_to_chinese/

And it seems that there are a lot (probably most) of people completely clueless about the widespread censorship that already occurs on reddit. And in addition, they somehow think they'll be able to tell when censorship occurs! 


&#x200B;

I [wrote about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/apig51/rtheoryofreddit_mods_remove_thread_and_all/) in a few different subs recently, which you can find in my submission history, but here are some main takeaways:

* Over the past 5+ years Reddit has gone from being the best site for extensive information sharing and lengthy discussion, to being one of the most censored sites on the internet, with many subs regularly secretly removing more than 40% of the content. With the Tencent investment it simply seems like censorship is officially a part of Reddit's business model. 

* A small amount of random people/mods who ""got there first"" control most of reddit. They are accountable to no one, and everyone is subject to the whims of their often capricious, self-serving, and abusive behavior. 


* Most of reddit is censored completely secretly. By default there is no notification or reason given when any content is removed. Mod teams have to make an effort to notify users and cite rules. Many/most mods do not bother with this. This can extend to bans as well, which can be done silently via automod configs. Modlogs are private by default and mod teams have to make an effort to make them public. 

* Reddit finally released the mod guidelines after years of complaints, but the admins do not enforce them. Many mods publicly boast about this fact. 

* The tools to see when censorship happens are ceddit.com, removeddit.com, revddit.com ([more info](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apu3oz/with_the_recent_chinese_company_tencent_in_the/eq83p0a/)), and using ""open in new private window"" for all your comments and submissions. You simply replace the ""reddit.com/r/w.e"" in the address to ceddit.com/r/w.e""

/r/undelete tracks things that were removed from the front page, but most censorship occurs well before a post makes it to the front page. 

There are a number of /r/RedditAlternatives that are trying to address the issues with reddit. 

EDIT: Guess I should mention a few notables:

I set up my Raspberry Pi to automatically tweet at Comcast Xfinity whenever my internet speeds drop significantly below what I pay for,51364,0.92,43fi39,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/43fi39/i_set_up_my_raspberry_pi_to_automatically_tweet/,3008,2016-1-31,"https://twitter.com/a_comcast_user

I pay for 150mbps down and 10mbps up. The raspberry pi runs a series of speedtests every hour and stores the data. Whenever the downspeed is below 50mbps the Pi uses a twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. 

I know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50mpbs down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied. I am aware that the Pi that I have is limited to ~100mbps on its Ethernet port (but seems to top out at 90) so when I get 90 I assume it is also higher and possibly up to 150.

Comcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address...usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values. I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.

The Pi also runs a website server local to our network where with a graphing library I can [see the speeds over different periods of time](http://i.imgur.com/qdnnLzg.png).



EDIT: A lot of folks have pointed out that the results are possibly skewed by our own network usage. We do not torrent in our house; we use the network to mainly stream TV services and play PC and Xbone live games. I set the speedtest and graph portion of this up (without the tweeting part) earlier last year when the service was so constatly bad that Netflix wouldn't go above 480p and I would have >500ms latencies in CSGO. I service was constantly below 10mbps down. I only added the Twitter portion of it recently and yes, admittedly the service has been better.

Plenty of the drops were during hours when we were not home or everyone was asleep, and I  am able to download steam games or stream Netflix at 1080p and still have the speedtest registers its near its maximum of ~90mbps down, so when we gets speeds on the order of 10mpbs down and we are not heavily using the internet we know the problem is not on our end.

EDIT 2: People asked for the source code. PLEASE USE THE CLEANED UP CODE BELOW. I am by no means some fancy programmer so there is no need to point out that my code is ugly or could be better. http://pastebin.com/WMEh802V

The momentum is continuing to build. In the past few days Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Adblock, Twilio, and some other big names [have joined.](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-06-22-net-neutrality-day-of-action-gets-another-huge/) Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 80 subreddits!

We've started solidifying ideas for the types of messages that sites can display on the day of the protest, and you can [check those out here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/#join) (feedback is welcome!) 

EDIT: A little more info about the plan: on July 12 websites will display a prominent message on their homepage, and apps and services will send push notifications or do whatever makes the most sense for them to reach as many people as possible. We'll direct people to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), an optimized action site that easily allows anyone to submit a comment to the FCC and Congress at the same time, make a phone call, and sign up to participate in meetings with lawmakers. We'll also have video bumpers that YouTubers and other video creators can use. Basically, everyone should think about how they can use the power of the Internet to reach their audience with a message abotu net neutrality and make it easy for them to take action.

**Important context from my previous update below.**

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. "

Comcast’s Corporate response to my recent Reddit front page post (“Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees”) sends clear message: Comcast does not give a sh*t about customers – unless your story goes national.,44521,0.92,2duzfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2duzfi/comcasts_corporate_response_to_my_recent_reddit/,2215,2014-8-18,"*Before I can even begin to justify the very charged title of this post, I beg of you to please bear with me and allow me to share the entire context of what has transpired.*

I am Dann Furia, OP of [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) which made the top spot on Reddit’s front page four days ago, highlighting a common Comcast phenomenon: customers getting repeatedly billed for “Unreturned” equipment and other fees.

**The purpose of this post is two-fold:**

* Share my (previously untold on Reddit) entire Comcast story
* Address Comcast’s response to my recent front page Reddit post about Comcast’s fees


**Part I - MY ENTIRE COMCAST STORY**

**During the six month period from mid-January of 2014 through the end of July of 2014, I had to contact Comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my Comcast account.**  I kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as January of this year, and by early July I had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with Comcast, that I additionally began recording my interactions with them.

During the above-referenced six month period, Comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything.  Now, I completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as Comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that I have previously documented at length each of [25 Consecutive Failed Comcast Interactions here in a four page Comcast blog] (http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that I possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims.  While my four page Comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of Comcast customer handling.  At a minimum, my four page Comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service.


**Part 2 - COMCAST’S RESPONSE TO MY FRONT PAGE REDDIT POST ABOUT COMCAST’S NOTORIOUS FEES**

As noted above, I tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from January through July of 2014 to get Comcast to help me.  Comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me.  Put more poignantly, Comcast played an incredibly effective game of “Annoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices."" (Bill Maher, 7/25/14).

Then, *after* my [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) post topped the Reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, Comcast’s Corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours.  I repeat - not a SINGLE Comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden Comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours?  That is interesting.

When I listened to the first voicemail from Comcast Corporate, I felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me.  But by the time I made my way through five consecutive Comcast Corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my “Comcast fees” post went Reddit-viral, I literally began to feel sick to my stomach by Comcast’s response.  Now, I understand that when a Comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, Comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge.  I also concede – flat out – a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that Comcast finally responded to me.  Having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between Comcast’s treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a “Special / Going Public” customer (5 Corporate messages in 18 hours).

All indications are that Comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of Philadelphia – and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my Comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect).  I, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of Comcast Purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape.  So please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective:  In a six month period this year, Comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while I was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a Literally-Unremovable $960 Termination Fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time.

Comcast’s effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? Zero. Zilch. None. Null. Devoid.
Comcast’s response when I cancelled my account?  They buried me $1320 in fees.
Comcast’s response when I went public to complain?  Their Corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours.

**And so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a Comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that Comcast has caused a customer:** First, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get Comcast to help you, then – if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your Comcast experience](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast), then [share part of your story with Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/), be fortunate enough to receive incredible & overwhelming support that vaults your post to the Reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from The Verge, Gawker, & International Business Times).  Perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get Comcast to clean up a mess they’ve created.

It appears, for the time being, that I might just escape from Comcastic Purgatory.  

But believe me when I say this with heartfelt sincerity: I feel genuinely sorry for the rest of you poor souls."

[Here's a screencapture for cellphone data plans in México](http://imgur.com/yYobj7x), which show how carriers basically discriminate data use based on which social network you browse/consume.

I wanted to post this here because I keep finding all these mockups about how Net Neutrality ""might look"" which -albeit correct in it's assumptions- get wrong the business model end of what companies would do with their power.

Basically, what the mockups show... a world where ""regular price for top companies vs pay an extra if you're a small company"", non-net neutral competition in México is actually based on who gives away more ""free app time"". Eg: ""You can order 3 Uber rides for free, no data use, with us!""

Which I guess makes more sense. The point is still the same though... ISPs are looking inside your data packets to make these content discrimination decisions.

You'll have to pay extra to stream at 720p again. 
If you pay for UNLIMITED: You now get throttled after 20 gigs, and devices connected to your mobile hotspot cannot exceed 600kbps. If you're paying the gig though, you still get 4G speeds, ironic moneygrab.



Straight from an email I received today:

Update on cellular video resolution and personal hotspots
We wanted to let you know about two changes to your Xfinity Mobile service that'll go into effect in the coming weeks.

Video resolution

To help you conserve data, we've established 480p as the standard resolution for streaming video through cellular data. This can help you save money if you pay By the Gig and take longer to reach the 20 GB threshold if you have the Unlimited data option. 

Later this year, 720p video over cellular data will be available as a fee-based option with your service. In the meantime, you can request it on an interim basis at no charge. Learn more

This update only affects video streaming over cellular data. You can continue to stream HD-quality video over WiFi, including at millions of Xfinity WiFi hotspots.

Personal hotspots

If you have the Unlimited data option, your speeds on any device connected to a personal hotspot will not exceed 600 Kbps. At this speed, you'll conserve data so that it takes longer to reach the 20 GB threshold but you'll still be able to do many of the online activities you enjoy.

Want faster speeds when using a personal hotspot? The By the Gig data option will continue to deliver 4G speeds for all data traffic."

[](http://youtu.be/PRLgG9ctZGg)

EDIT: I'm glad this is getting some attention. Last night I sent the video to We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com and
ecare@comcast.com , as well as the tips address for the Consumerist. Today I submitted an FCC complaint per the suggestion of /u/BarbwireCake. I've only received an automated response from Comcast so far. Some are suggesting that a class action lawsuit might be a catalyst for change; I'm not sure. I will update when I hear from someone.
(12:17PST)
Filed with BBB and posted to [twitter](https://twitter.com/Sweetlethargy/status/550033447729643520)
(13:04PST)

EDIT:
I spoke with someone from Comcast Executive Customer Relations. He wanted to discuss my complaint, but refused to be recorded. I record all of my calls with creditors so that I won't be promised something that is never delivered. As I found out yesterday, it might not even matter if the call has been recorded. Luckily this thread got some attention today, so I might actually get help with this issue. He assured me that I would change my mind about Comcast after speaking with him but I declined to continue the conversation. I've obviously learned my lesson today about keeping accurate records, and I don't want to hear anymore crocodile tears or pseudo-promises.
In any case, he said he would email me details of our non-conversation, which I will place here:

--
Hello /u/sweetlethargy, I regret not being able to consent to your recording our conversation due to  the nature of the reasons or possible intent that you may have for the recording. In reviewing the original and unedited version of your initial call, the agent gave you correct information on the service plan and promotional services at the time of the call. This is the product and service that you spoke about:

Internet Plus 09/06 - 10/05 69.95

Includes Limited Basic, HBO, Streampix, a
Standard Definition Digital Converter and
Remote For The Primary Outlet, and
Performance Internet.

Service Discount -19.96

Total XFINITY TV $49.99 plus taxes and fees

Franchise Fee 1.42

Utility Tax 2.00

PEG Access Support 0.28

State Sales Tax 0.16

FCC User Fee 0.09

Total Taxes, Surcharges & Fees $3.95 (these vary slightly per month and are only collected by Comcast)
 
Docsis 3 Owned Mdm 09/06 - 10/05 0.00

Blast! Internet Svc 09/06 - 10/05 11.00

Service Discount -11.00

Total XFINITY Internet $0.00 (this was added after your conversation with the agent as a bonus) which may have caused this confusion

We have extended this promotional offer as a gesture of good will for an additional 12 months as long as you understand that at the end of that term if you wish to keep it, it will be billed at its standard rate.
--

It seems that they aren't accepting responsibility for anything, but they are offering me something. Here is my response. (All I want is what I was quoted):

--
Bottom line: do I have 100mbps down, 25mbps up, no contract, at $53.85 total per month including taxes and all other fees for 12 months?
--

Im waiting for a response.

For people who were asking, I used the android app Automatic Call Recorder by Appliqato. Everyone should record conversations with their creditors to keep them accountable.
(18:24PST)

**FINAL UPDATE:**

Just spoke with an ""Executive Customer Relations Supervisor"" who apologized for the actions of the two customer retention reps, as well as the Executive Customer Relations rep who refused to be recorded yesterday. She was very polite, took full responsibility for Comcast's mistakes, and allowed me to record our conversation. She explained that ""both representatives you reached were freshly out of a training class"" and they ""should've placed you on hold"" to get more information. This is strange, since I could clearly hear the second rep being coached on what to say... 

In any case, the Executive Customer Relations Supervisor said she would credit me a month of service as a sign of good will. She also explained that I would be receiving the promotional rate through August 15th 2015, however, due to the fluctuation of taxes and fees, she could not guarantee my final cost of $53.85. This month the final cost would be $55.55, for example. I indicated that all I wanted was the out-the-door $53.85 cost that I was quoted in August. I agree that the dollar amount is negligable, but all I've wanted is the price I was quoted when I agreed to keep the service. She agreed to credit my account $5 every month so that at no time I would be expected to pay more than $53.85.

Today I Learned that if Comcast pushes you around, the best course of action is to expose them on social media. I can honestly say that this has been easier, less time consuming, and less stressful to make and post the video than it would've been to dial 1-800-COMCAST again. I hope these Comcast horror stories continue to get posted so that something might change one day. Proper competition is the only answer to this solution, and I personally feel that public utilies should also operate as ISPs.

Everyone should be recording their interactions with creditors, as it is obviously the only way to keep them (somewhat) honest. It's sad that I was granted my simple request only after my video had been posted to the Consumerist, Techdirt, BGR, Gawker, yahoo, etc, etc... I realize that most people will simply never receive help with their complaints.

Good luck to all of you who are dealing with similar situations.

**tldr; I'm now getting what I was quoted: 100mbps down, 25mbps up, through August 15th, no contract, for no more than $53.85 per month.**

Earlier this week, Sunlight Foundation [released a study](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/12/16/one-group-dominates-the-second-round-of-net-neutrality-comments/) claiming that anti-Title II comments from a group with ties to the Koch Brothers “dominated” the second round of FCC commenting, beating out comments from pro-net neutrality groups like EFF and Fight for the Future. Now, [anti-net neutrality groups](http://www.americancommitment.org/content/conservatives-opposed-internet-regulation-won-fcc-comment-period-landslide) and [journalists](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/12/18/dirty-data-why-the-4-million-public-comments-on-net-neutrality-might-not-be-what-they-seem/) are seizing on this report to try to make it look like the public is against Title II net neutrality. The problem is, the FCC’s data was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments, and I can prove it. To make things worse, Sunlight’s study counted every anti-net neutrality comment while systematically ignoring pro-net neutrality comments. It’s a mess.

**Full disclosure:** I’m Jeff Lyon, CTO at Fight for the Future, a pro-net neutrality group responsible for driving 777,364 pro-net neutrality comments through the Battle for the Net campaign. I’m posting this here, along with all of our evidence, with the hope that Reddit can help us verify these claims.

**The FCC data dump was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments.**

The raw data [the FCC released](http://www.fcc.gov/blog/fcc-releases-open-internet-reply-comments-public) and that Sunlight used for its study was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments sent from Battle for the Net. I noticed this and emailed the FCC’s Chief Enterprise Architect, who confirmed via email that, of over 525,000 comments we submitted via CSV, _at least_ 244,811 were missing from the data that the FCC released (**[screenshot of email from FCC](http://s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/fcc_email_redacted.png)**). As of right now, the failure point is still unclear: did the FCC simply fail to export these comments, or did they actually fail to process them in the first place?

Worse, of the comments the FCC _did_ include, Sunlight found that 95,000 of them were duplicates—the same comment showing up multiple times, and this means an additional 95,000 of the unique comments we sent are missing. (I verified we did in fact send unique comments by examining reference numbers attached to them, can’t exactly prove this without violating our privacy policy)

Taking 244,811 + 95,000 gives us _at least_ 339,811 pro-net neutrality comments that are provably missing from the data. This is alone is enough to unseat Sunlight’s (methodologically-flawed) conclusion that anti-net neutrality comments “dominated” the second round, and the total number of missing comments is probably much higher.

Sunlight analyzed 1,674,385 comments and determined a 60 / 40 split between anti- / pro-net neutrality comments. They didn’t specify, but if we conservatively assume that 0% of the comments were undecided or ambiguous, then this amounts to 1,004,631 anti-net neutrality and 669,754 comments. Adding in the 339,811 proveably missing pro-net neutrality comments gives us 1,009,565, shifting the dominant group in favor of net neutrality (this margin would be increased if we assumed more than 0% of comments were ambiguous, and if Sunlight’s logic wasn’t completely flawed [more on that soon]).


**There are probably many more missing comments.**

The total number of missing comments is probably much higher than the number I’ve (thus far) identified. To help establish this, it’s useful to examine the different ways that people could submit net neutrality comments to the FCC, as well as the precise approach I used to determine these numbers.

In the beginning, there was [ECFS](http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment_search/execute?proceeding=14-28), the FCC’s online commenting system. This system is over a decade old and melted down from the hundreds of thousands of comments sent through Battle for the Net and by fans of [comedian John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU) during the first round of net neutrality comments. (I believe on good authority that the FCC has just one server running the entire ECFS web site :)

The FCC soon realized that ECFS wasn’t working, and [started accepting comments by email](http://www.fcc.gov/page/fcc-establishes-new-inbox-open-internet-comments). However in September, right before the second net neutrality commenting deadline, the FCC made it possible to submit comments in bulk using CSV spreadsheets. Given the sheer volume of comments we were collecting through Battle for the Net, this option made the most sense in order to ensure timely delivery to the FCC.

Unfortunately, it seems that CSV option was unreliable. Over half the comments we submitted via CSV were missing from the FCC’s final data, and in Sunlight’s study, no comments were attributed to some other big companies that participated with Battle for the Net and submitted CSV comments on behalf of their users. If the FCC actually failed to process comments from these groups, the total number of pro-net neutrality comments would be even higher.

It’s also worth noting, the technique I used to determine the missing CSV comments is simplistic and only establishes a floor, not a ceiling, for the possible total missing. Here’s what I did:

* Battle for the Net submitted 527,952 unique comments via CSV to the FCC between the dates of September 12 and September 15
* Of these comments, 525,189 contained the phrase ‘We are writing to urge you to implement’ (people were signing onto an open letter from Senator Angus King)
* If all of these were counted, we would expect to see at least as many occurrences of that phrase in the [raw data](http://www.fcc.gov/files/ecfs/14-28/R-14-28-02-SOLR-RAW.zip ) released by the FCC, but instead there were only 374,421 occurrences.
* Of these, 374,421 occurrences, FCC’s Chief Enterprise Architect confirmed via email (**[screenshot of another email from FCC](http://s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/emails.png)**) that 92,645 were from comments submitted through the FCC’s email address, meaning that 281,776 is the maximum number of comments possibly from the CSV files in their data, and they were missing at least 244,811.
* We only did a basic text search to arise at this number. If other people submitted comments with the phrase ‘We are writing to urge you to implement’, it would mean that _even less_ of our CSV comments made it into the final data.
* And of the 374,421 matches that were in the data, Sunlight confirmed that at least 95,000 were duplicate records, meaning that at least another 95,000 of the comments we sent are also missing.

We still don’t know whether comments submitted via ECFS were properly reflected in the FCC’s data. I’m running a full analysis, comparing our data to theirs, but it will take some time to complete.

**To make things worse, Sunlight’s study counted every anti-net neutrality comment and systematically ignored pro-net neutrality comments**

The Sunlight Foundation studied the FCC’s data and concluded that comments from net neutrality activists were eclipsed by anti-regulatory comments from American Commitment, a known astroturfing group with ties to the Koch Brothers (they sent paid emails with misleading messages, but that’s [another story](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-conservative-anti-net-neutrality-movement-that-wasnt)). However, Sunlight applied a flawed sampling methodology to a flawed set of data, and drew conclusions that are impossible to make with any “reasonably representative” certainty.

In particular, of the 2.4 million comments released by the FCC, they ignored 800,000 comments that they couldn’t parse, and assumed these comments maintained the same distribution of pro- vs. anti- net neutrality comments. They’ve said the 1.6 million comments they did look at were “reasonably representative” of the whole group, but have provided no evidence to support that claim.

I’ve looked at the data myself. It’s extremely inconsistent, with comments in a multitude of formats, some plaintext, some XML, and many simply as concatenated strings with no delimiting characters separating them from one another. It’s generally very difficult to parse. However, it’s extremely easy to pick out and parse the email comments, as they tend to follow a consistent format.

The group of commenters that “dominated” the second round of comments (in Sunlight’s words) could have simply been the one organization that–due to the technique it used for submitting–didn’t get all its submissions garbled. In fact, it looks like that’s what happened. The FCC counted _all 92,645_ of the comments we sent via email, and failed to parse comments we sent via CSV. On the other hand, _all 777,364_ anti-net neutrality comments from American Commitment were sent via email, present in the FCC’s data, and counted in Sunlight’s study.

What this means is that, after Sunlight threw 800,000 comments away, half of their remaining sample pool of 1.6 million comments are easily parseable emails from American Commitment.

It is erroneous to assume that you can throw away a third of your data and that the distribution of the remaining data will be unaffected. Taking this further, Sunlight has publicly acknowledged a non-trivial difference in how they counted some comments from pro-net neutrality groups like Free Press versus comments from American Commitment.

All groups were effectively collecting signatures on a letter. American Commitment submitted them as a barrage of identical comments, while groups like Free Press submitted them as signatures on a single letter. The FCC says it recognizes and counts both. But Sunlight Foundation admits they chose to treat them differently, excluding multiple signatures on a single letter from the count.

This further confounded the result of their study in favor of anti-net neutrality commenters.

**TL;DR:**

* FCC failed to process hundreds of thousands of net neutrality comments
* Sunlight Foundation based a study on the FCC’s data, counted every anti-net neutrality comment and systematically ignored pro-net neutrality comments. Concluded that anti-net neutrality “dominated”
* Political pundits and journalists are spinning this to say that the public is against net neutrality
* I wanted to get the facts out in the hopes that Reddit verify this, further analyze the FCC's data, and help figure out what's going on."

Skip to the numbered part and I'll teach you how to protect yourself. I will not explain in detail how these things work in this post, because I want anyone, regardless of their tech prowess, to find these suggestions accessible. It is also because I am by no means an expert in this area, and do not wish to spread misinformation. Luckily, the information is readily available all over the net, if you would like to know more.]***

> **(UPDATE 12/20/2015: I just want to point out that I am aware that a few of my suggestions have been disputed in the comments. I am *OKAY* with that. In fact, I *encourage* it. A few people seem to be getting heated, and there is just no reason for that. I am just some dude on the internet looking to help out. These are all just suggestions that work *for me*. I am sharing with you what I know. None of these tips will cause you any harm, I promise, though an alternative might suit *your* purposes better. Please, I implore you to take what I say with a grain of salt and do your own research. Feel free to tell me I'm wrong in the comments, but please be kind to one another. I will make updates and corrections as needed, so please check back now and again.)**

I promise, I am not as crazy and paranoid as this post is about to make me seem. This is just an important issue to me as a techy/geek. [This is important for you as well, I swear](http://www.zdnet.com/article/if-you-have-nothing-to-hide-heres-where-to-send-your-passwords/), so grab your tinfoil hats and come to [Crazy Town](http://www.weebls-stuff.com/other-toons/video/aaaaaaaaaaaaahaha.html) with me for a moment.

Basically, [CISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity_Information_Sharing_Act) has been signed into law. For those that don't know what this means, many corporations and the Department of Homeland Security now have greater access to your online activity and can do with it what they will. There are scary implications of this that I could ramble about; but, honestly, they will *probably* never happen to you or I. But it's the principle of the thing that concerns me.

There are three important things that everyone should have a right to as a ""citizen of the internet"": *Privacy*, *Anonymity*, and *Security*. CISA is a blatant invasion of the first two, particularly Privacy. You do not have to be doing anything illegal to warrant a need to private access to the internet. You just simply should not be spied on. You are being violated. It doesn't matter if you're just returning an email to your grandma, or buying some shoes--there is no reason that your activity should be monitored, recorded, and passed around unless there is some solid evidence pointing to you extorting your grandma or stealing those shoes.

The legislation was [trojan-horsed](http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/18/house-senate-pass-budget-with-cisa/) in on a budget bill and signed off by the Prez himself, so nothing can be done to reverse it. At least not yet. The good news is, there are things *YOU* can do right now to maintain your rights. *All of the following tips are completely legal (in the USA), freely available, relatively simple to use, and within your rights to use as you wish.*

&nbsp;

**[Pro tips begin here!]**

&nbsp;

**1. Privacy:** Use a VPN service. [Cyberghost](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us?utm_expid=85864364-18._HAGhHhTTvKkQRZylpXQXw.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) and ~~TunnelBear~~ both offer excellent free services. If you want even better service, there are a few excellent paid services, as well (I don't know any well enough to endorse one, but I've heard good things about NordVPN. It's got 256-bit AES encryption and is completely logless). 

> (**UPDATE:** It was brought to my attention that TunnelBear, while adorable, is not logless and is hosted within the USA. It is therefor not recommended for privacy. It's good if you want to get around a site blocker at work or school, but for REAL privacy, use a reputable paid VPN service. Regardless of arguments, though, the free version of Cyberghost *will* help you maintain Privacy. It is hosted out of the US, it is logless, and they make their revenue from paid subscriptions and will not sell your information. That is not to say that a paid service is not better, it's just that Cyberghost's free service will be safe for you to use.)

The merit of VPNs is debated around the internet, but I have found them to be indispensable in maintaining my own privacy, as they are quick and easy to connect to and are one of the simplest and most effective tools of allowing you to maintain your privacy. 

There are also small program switches you can make. For example, switch from Skype to [qTox](https://tox.chat/). It is a more steady, reliable program that offers all of the same services as Skype, but with excellent end-to-end encryption and it's logless, much like a good VPN. Your conversations will remain between you and the other person only. It's also available on a wide variety of platforms, so it should work for almost anyone. 

Also consider using a more secure email provider. If you want to keep it net-based, use ~~HushMail~~. If you like a client installed on your PC, combine your secure email account with a program called [ThunderBird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/), which allows you to easily manage multiple email accounts, among other cool, secure features. 

> (**UPDATE:** I stand corrected. /u/theforcereturns was able to show me that HushMail is *NOT* your most secure option. A much better option, as per his recommendation, would be [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/). I've looked into it, and I will be making the switch myself. It's based out of Switzerland and has true end-to-end encryption, among other features that help to privatize and anonymity your email, PLUS--it's free. Super rad. The only downside is that as of now, you have to request an invite and wait for an account due to their need to expand the size of their servers.

> He also wanted me to include some information regarding instant messaging. He recommended [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal/) or [Telegram](https://telegram.org/). Signal, in particular, as it was developed by a highly reputable team--however, it is only available for mobile devices. Telegram offers a client for PC, as well. I have personally used [Wickr](https://www.wickr.com/), and I know it to be very secure and reliable. 

> If you MUST use Facebook Messenger (*which I do not recommend in the slightest*), then the best way to do it is to connect through [Pigdin](https://pidgin.im/) with the [OTR Plug-In](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) and the current [Messenger compatability](https://github.com/jgeboski/purple-facebook/wiki#basic-usage). The only drag is that your other party MUST have this setup, too, and you will have to authenticate each other. But the plus is that your Facebook messages will be encrypted. Still though, either way, don't send sensitive messages over Facebook. Never. Never ever. Don't. Like... do not. Ever.

Another good idea is to reconsider the search engines you use. Google and Bing are notorious data compilers. I use ~~DuckDuckGo~~ instead. It's fast, accurate, and totally private and anonymous. They do not collect data on you. 

> (**UPDATE:** Some redditors are claiming DuckDuckGo to be less-than-reputable. I can't confirm or deny that as of now, so in lieu of that, I suggest you check out [StartPage](https://startpage.com/) or [PrivateSearch.io](https://www.privatesearch.io/). Both are great, secure search engines. StartPage is slowly becoming my new personal favorite.)

I also want to mention (legal) File Sharing. I'd like to add that [BitDrop](https://bitdropapp.com/) is an awesome tool for anonymous, secure file sharing between your devices. As mentioned above, qTox also has secure file sharing capability.

You can also get a free [MEGA](https://mega.nz/#fm/c1UwVZAZ) account. While not the most secure, if you use Winrar or 7Zip to create an encrypted RAR file with a conspicuous name and send it over HushMail, Tox, etc. to your friend/receiver of the file separate from the decryption password/MEGA access code, it will be secure enough (for non-sensitive documents and files), and you can upload up to 50GB with a free account. Just remember to delete the files from your account AND the rubbish bin after the other party has received them. 

> (**UPDATE:** MEGA is *NOT* to be used as a secure, private file sharing tool. Please see my second edit at the bottom of this post.)

Another option is to create a torrent file of the encrypted RAR file and seed it directly to the other party, after both of you have configured your torrent clients to run all traffic through a proxy.

If you're especially tech-savvy, you can even go so far as to install CFW on your router, provided it's supported, like [Tomato](http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato) or [DD-WRT](http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index). Tomato in particular will allow you to actively monitor your bandwidth activity to see who is accessing your network, or even just to see if Comcast is throttling your Netflix usage. 

&nbsp;

**2. Anonymity:** Again, you don't have to be a criminal to want to keep your anonymity online. Download the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en). It's a modified version of Firefox that allows you to route all of your activity online through the Onion server network. *(Pro tip: Tor will not protect you when downloading or torrenting anything, legal or not. If you engage in a peer-to-peer download, you will inevitably upload real personal information about your system, AND it slows down the Tor network for everybody else. The safest way to download is through a [torrent client](http://www.oldapps.com/utorrent.php?old_utorrent=38?download) that has been [configured to work with a Proxy or VPN](https://www.bolehvpn.net/utorrent.html), but nothing is guaranteed. [Here](http://samair.ru/) is a list of free public proxy servers you may use. Always check the validity of your proxy server [here](http://samair.ru/s-proxychecker/index.php) before each use).* 

(Please note that I **DO NOT** condone piracy or illegal activity of **ANY KIND**. I am simply suggesting uTorrent as a means of securely sharing legally obtained or created files between two parties.)

> (**UPDATE:** Yes, recent versions of uTorrent have been shown to include spyware. Settle down. The version that I linked to above is version 2.2.1, arguably the best version of uTorrent, more lightweight, and spyware free. If you want to forego uTorrent entirely, go with [qBittorent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/), an open source bittorent client that I personally use in addition to uTorrent. It's excellent. A lot of redditors have also recommended Deluge, which looks promising, but I have never used it personally.)

Also, NEVER open a downloaded file while still connected to Tor, especially a PDF. There are often traces of data that ""call home"" when the file is opened, and it can void any protection Tor offers you.

It's also good practice to visit HTTPS versions of sites whenever possible, as they are more secure. The Tor bundle includes a browser plug-in called [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) that will automatically get you the most secure connection to sites whenever possible. You can also add it to your regular Chrome, Firefox, or Opera browsers, and on Android devices.

You might also consider [spoofing your MAC address](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Spoof-Your-MAC-Address/) now and again. 

> (**UPDATE:** Spoofing your MAC is only necessary if you think your LAN has been compromised from the ""inside."" Otherwise, don't worry about it.)

The last thing I will say on anonymity, for the more tech-savvy again, is that you may consider using something like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to run a more secure operating system INSIDE of another operating system. You can also just install that more secure OS on a flash drive, but I find the VirtualBox to be easier to manage AND  that it provides more anonymity. I personally would recommend using [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox) with VB. It's very effective. I've also heard good things about Tails, but apparently it's not truly logless, and I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it, as I have never used it.

Finally, it's important to know your stuff is working. To test my level of anonymity, I like to use [IP Check](http://ip-check.info/?lang=en) and [Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/).

&nbsp;

**3. Security:** Not really relevant to CISA, but it's important, too. ~~Ditch McAffee, Kaspersky, or whatever junk you paid for.~~ Download [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/lp/sem/?sfc=sem-gs_b_us_en&gclid=CMCSvNKO6ckCFY9gfgodrZED8Q), [Panda Antivirus](http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/free-antivirus/), and [CCleaner](https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download). 

> (**Update:** Just to clarify, CCleaner is NOT an antivrus, and I do not claim that it is. Clearing your registry is just a good practice for security and in general.) 

All free, all easy to use, all great at what they do. Just allow them to update regularly and run automatic scans each night. If you prefer paid software, Kaspersky has the highest detection rate and is super reliable software. There are other good options, as well.

&nbsp;

**Final Notes:** These are just *BASIC* tips to help you protect yourself. This will not make you invisible; if someone still wants to spy on you, they could... but they'll actually have to work for it. There's a lot more you can do to abstract your digital ""fingerprint"". But either way, care about your privacy. Protect yourself. As far fetched as it seems, due to the nature of the issue, the more people that do this stuff, the more secure everyone becomes (especially in regards to Tor use).

>*""Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.""* -- Edward Snowden

> **EDIT:** A lovely anonymous user posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3xj5fe/now_that_cisa_has_passed_here_are_some_tips_to/cy52yyp) with links to further reading, if you're interested. 

&nbsp;

> **EDIT: PART DEUX:** Some redditors have pointed out a few things to be wary of that I should have included in the original post. Later versions of uTorrent have been found to come with spyware. The version I linked to is an older version (2.2.1) and it safe for you to use. If you want to forego uTorrent altogether, qBittorent is an excellent alternative, that I use myself on occasion. It's completely open source, which is groovy, too. 

> Also, MEGA is NOT by any means a secure way of file sharing. I meant to say that if it is NOT a particularly sensitive document you're sending, and it's encrypted, it works in a pinch. Please do not rely on it for secure sharing. There are some good recommendations below in the comments for you to investigate. I won't name any specific ones, as I have not tested them myself. 

> Also Also, one user (I lost his name in the vast ocean that is my inbox--I now I understand what ""RIP My Inbox"" means--but as soon as I find it again, I will credit you, kind stranger) pointed out that unless you select the options to ENCRYPT the email you send with HushMail, it will only send through the clearnet as a normal email and will NOT be secure. Don't forget to encrypt your emails, kids.

> Finally, I just want to make it clear, NONE of this will make you ""invisible."" It simply helps to scatter the information that makes up you ""fingerprint"" to A) Make it less reliable to track you with, and B) to give up less personal data to prying eyes. *YES* the contents of you hard drive are probably compromised if you're not using Whonix or Tails. *YES* the NSA can still watch you if they want to. IF someone REALLY wants to get to you, especially the govt., they still can. This isn't a guide to disappearing completely. This is a guide for the average Joe or Jane, who are not cybercriminals, to regain their privacy online. This won't save you if you're trafficking drugs, but it WILL keep a substantial amount of nosey trackers off your back and help you regain your privacy.

&nbsp;

> **HE'S EDIT AGAIN:** Holy *shit* this post blew up. First of all, THANK YOU for gold, kind stranger. That is awfully kind. I luh you.

> Second, a lot of people are discussing what I recommended for ""Security."" First of all, I said straight up, it basically has nothing to do with CISA. It's just something I believe to be a fundamental right as an internet user and wanted to include. But I also apologize for referring to paid anti-virus software as ""junk."" Most of it is not junk, I do not mean to confuse you. I used Kaspersky for a year or two back in 2011 or so, and it was great. A lot of those programs have a lot to offer, and they work very well. For my purposes, the free anti-virus software does everything I need it to do and more, so it is not worth it to pay for the software. Your purposes may be different, and at the end of the day, it's all about what works for you. So, no, paid antivirus software is not junk. I apologize for the misrepresentation.  

> It should also be noted that spoofing your MAC is JUST for if you think you have been compromised from within your own LAN network. 

> As I stated before, I am no expert. Just a guy who has done a lot of research on his own, trying to do a solid for his fellow internet-users. Everything I suggest is just that--a suggestion. It's what works for me based off the research I have done. I encourage you to take my advice with a grain of salt and do research on your own to see what works for you. But I would venture to say that what I have written is a solid starting point on your journey to a more private, anonymous, and secure browsing experience. Serve hot with a side of common sense. 

&nbsp;

> **EDIT EPISODE IV: A NEW DNS SERVER:** Your DNS server. Change that shizz. I recommend [DNS.Watch](https://dns.watch/index). A redditor (who's name I'll have to hunt down) recommended it to me, I've played with it, and it's great so far. OpenDNS is also good. DON'T use Google DNS. I did for a long time. It's effective, but they absolutely store and use your DNS look-up records. If you use Google's, drop it now.

&nbsp;

> **FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE US WONDERING IF THIS AFFECTS THEM:** Yes. And no. Yes, if you visit sites hosted in the US, but no, the legislature itself does not extend beyond the US border, as I understand it. Your country may or may not have it's own laws regarding the matter.

&nbsp;

At first, I though these sound bites were completely random. Then I began to notice a pattern. Soon, I realized that I was hearing peoples commands given to their mobile devices.
Guys, I'm telling you, if you've said it to your phone, it's been recorded...and there's a damn good chance a 3rd party is going to hear it.


I heard everything from kiddos asking innocent things like ""Siri, do you like me?"" to some guy asking Galaxy to lick his butthole. I wish I was kidding.


Just a heads up Reddit. I've heard more text-to-speech sexting than I care to. (You've never hear something sexy until you've heard a guy with a slight Indian accent slowly enunciate ""I want to have sex with you"" to his texing app)
