Ajax youngster out of coma over a year after suffering heart attack,"THE BROTHER OF former Ajax youngster Abdelhak Nouri has offered a positive update on the condition of the 21-year-old following his on-field collapse back in July 2017.

The midfielder, who was a product of the famed academy system in Amsterdam, suffered a heart attack during a friendly clash with Werder Bremen.

He has been left with severe and permanent brain damage, with doctors having to put him into an induced coma as they sought to stabilise his condition.

Nouri is now awake again, with his family encouraged by the progress he is making through a “very difficult” time.

Abderrahim Nouri told NOS: “His neurological situation is better than a few months ago.

“Physically it’s very difficult, though. His physical condition is in decline because he doesn’t move. He’s lying in bed most of the time and he can’t move his body on his own. Only his head.

“Sometimes we get him out of bed to let him sit in his wheelchair. Earlier, that was really hard. At the beginning that was going really well, but later it became more difficult, with lots of ups and downs.

His immune system is weakened and it fluctuates a lot. I don’t want to go into details, but he has had a hard time. That’s normal for someone who has had brain damage. Those were very tough times.”

Abderrahim also reported that his brother is displaying greater awareness of those around him, allowing basic communication to be carried out.

Watch: Worcester lock Fatialofa in 'miracle' recovery from spine injury,"WORCESTER WARRIORS LOCK Michael Fatialofa is back walking unaided just weeks after he suffered a serious spine injury in what his wife described on Saturday as a “miracle”.

The 27-year-old New Zealander underwent spinal surgery in late January after being left paralysed from the neck down following his side’s Premiership rugby union match with Saracens early that month.

The operation took place after he was diagnosed with a spinal contusion, a serious condition which causes compression on the spine.

“You’re witnessing a miracle that even medical professionals can’t explain,” wrote Fatialofa’s wife Tatiana with a video of him walking on Instagram.

“They are so shook by his progress given his critical level of injury.

“He was literally paralysed from the neck down just 10 weeks ago and currently spinal cord injuries do not have a clinical cure.”

However, the coronavirus outbreak will place restrictions on her being able to visit him as the British government has recommended social distancing and ordered pubs, restaurants and other places where the public congregate to close.

“We’ve been advised by the hospital that visiting probably will be reduced to only one hour soon and while I understand completely it’s still so hard on the heart,” she said.

Fatialofa — who was a pivotal member of the Hurricanes side that won the 2016 Super Rugby title — has been affected in another way by the coronavirus as Worcester’s home game against Harlequins on April 11 was due to act as a fundraiser, but it will not go ahead with the Premiership currently suspended until April 14.

O'Mahony pleased by Kidney and Kiss to London Irish reports,"MUNSTER AND IRELAND back row Peter O’Mahony has welcomed reports that Declan Kidney is set for a return to rugby as London Irish coach with Les Kiss by his side.

The Telegraph reports that the duo, who helped Ireland to the Grand Slam in 2009, will reunite at the Exiles from next season.

Having worked under both, O’Mahony is well versed to share his opinion on the move, one which he feels is a positive one.

“Deccy gave me my first couple of caps and I know he’s been eager to get back into rugby,” the Munster skipper said.

“He’s been in college in UCC, he’s been looking after the players down there. But I met him a few weeks ago and I know he’s been eager to get back in, and it’s good to see him and Les get back stuck in.

“I have a huge amount of respect for the pair of them and it’s good to see them getting back in. Not that Les has been out for long but I knew he was going to get picked up quick, he’s an incredible coach.”

Two-time Heineken Cup winning coach Kidney left the Ireland job in 2013 and has not worked in rugby since, while Kiss departed his role as Ulster head coach last month.

The 61-year-old, who won five league titles, a European Cup and the FA Cup with Liverpool during the 1980s, underwent two operations and had a “cancerous blemish” removed from his face.

After a nervy wait, however, the former Ireland defender posted on Twitter last night to confirm that it hasn’t spread.

Lawrenson tweeted: “After three months of outstanding care at both Ormskirk & Whiston Hospitals, I got the news that after two operations and the removal of my facial cancerous blemish the cancer hasn’t spread anywhere. Phew!!

Waiting for the verdict felt like a ‘Sword of Damocles’ moment. Thanks all.”

In his column with the BBC, he revealed that it was a Football Focus viewer that first alerted him to the potential danger.

“Towards the end of last season, the editor of Football Focus received an email from a viewer saying they had seen me on TV and noticed I had a bit of dark skin on the left side of my face,” he wrote.

THE ‘CHOICE OF Champions’ slogan that was surely dreamed up by someone in O’Neills marketing team has taken on an added layer of meaning today as the sportswear company has begun manufacturing scrubs for healthcare workers.

The Co Tyrone based company temporarily laid off hundreds of staff in recent weeks, as the Covid-19 pandemic eliminated its order book.

Minister for Finance says corporation tax take is actually €1 billion higher than expected,"MINISTER FOR FINANCE Paschal Donohoe has said that the corporation tax take for the year will be €1 billion more than was originally expected.

The government’s projections of €8 billion have been exceeded due to changes in international accounting regulations, which means that multinational companies will be footing a much larger bill in Ireland this year, RTÉ reported.

This increased tax-take is unlikely to reoccur in future years, with €700 million of it deemed a once-off, and set to plug a shortfall in health spending in Budget 2019.

The Budget had been expected to run a deficit, but this will mean the government will balance the books heading into next year.

Addressing the Oireachtas Finance Committee late last month, Donohoe said that the government is “closing in on a balanced headline budgetary position”.

“The focus of Budget 2019 will be to sustain our recent progress and to maintain our careful management of the public finances,” he added.

153 players and staff were tested in the two provinces this week and the IRFU has happily reported that, for the second time, no one has tested positive.

Ulster and Connacht came through their own second round of PCR testing last week without any positive results.

The IRFU says that “to date there have been 560 tests conducted across the professional player and staff group” in the four provinces, with zero positives.

It means that all four provinces have been cleared to make their graduated return to contact training as they continue to build towards the scheduled Pro14 inter-provincial clashes at the Aviva Stadium next month.

Connacht GAA expect €3 million Air Dome to be completed in September,"CONNACHT GAA CHIEFS are confident work on their €3 million Air Dome project at the province’s centre of excellence in Mayo will be completed in early September.

Construction on the Air Dome in Bekan commenced last October but was halted in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Work on the facility, which will be the largest indoor sports facility of its kind in the world, recommenced last week after the country moved into phase 1 of the restrictions being eased.

“They’re back since Monday, it’s brilliant to be back on track,” Connacht secretary John Prenty told The42.

“We were almost ready to lay the pitch (before the lockdown). I’d say if we got maybe three weeks more without a shutdown we would have that the pitch laid and we’d be ready to be putting the actual dome together.

🚧 🏗

Terrific to have Prunty’s back onsite today working on the Air Dome at the Connacht GAA Centre in Bekan as the country moved into Phase 1 of the reopening plan. It has been a tough few weeks for everyone but today marks a positive step back towards normality! #connachtgaa pic.twitter.com/GCNNJLWf5a — Connacht GAA (@ConnachtGAA) May 18, 2020

“But that didn’t happen so now we’re about three weeks behind schedule. Hopefully by the middle of next week we’ll be ready to lay the carpet on the pitch. All the other work will have been done.”

The dome will be 150m x 100m and 26m high with a full size pitch, gym, testing area and office space inside. It will complement the provincial body’s existing facilities in Bekan.

Prenty is optimistic the pitches will be completed by next month with the entire project set to be finished in September.

“The timeline at the minute is looking like, the middle of June the pitches will be done,” he said.

The 27-year-old Ireland international second row joined the province last summer on an initial two-year deal but has settled in superbly and has already opted to pen new terms, adding a further two years to his contract.

Beirne, who spent two seasons in Wales with the Scarlets after leaving his native Leinster, has quickly become a key player for Johann van Graan’s side, providing a world-class turnover threat and impressive skill set, as well as growing into the lineout calling role.

Meanwhile, exciting 20-year-old scrum-half Craig Casey, who was recently named academy player of the year, has signed his first professional contract with Munster.

Casey, who helped the Ireland U20s to a Grand Slam earlier this year, will move onto a development contract next season before advancing onto a full senior deal in 2020/21.

However, the 29-year-old has had to be extremely patient as he attempts to hit those heights once again.

After complications with the injury, Judge eventually returned to the first-team squad back in December, and he has since made nine substitute appearances for the Bees.

DR VICTOR BAYDA, a native of Moscow, Russia, has been appointed as the Irish Language Planning Officer for the south Kerry Gaeltacht.

His role would be to promote and cultivate the use of Irish from day-to-day.

Comhchoiste Gaeltachta Uíbh Ráthach announced the appointment of Bayda, who was a lecturer of Irish in the Lomonosov State University in Moscow for 15 years.

Speaking to RTÉ, Bayda says he tries to visit Ireland every year to improve his Irish, and said that he’s aware of the challenges of his new role.

Bayda expressed a huge interest in languages since he was 13 years old, with a particular interest in Celtic languages, according to a statement from Údarás na Gaeltachta; although Welsh and Scots Gaelic first piqued his interest, it was the Irish language that he focused on.

While studying Dutch in Moscow Lomonosov State University, his interest in the Irish language grew and he subsequently undertook a doctorate in Irish.

Victor spent periods in Ireland, in Trinity College and in the Conamara Gaeltacht, learning the language and he achieved fluency with the support of the community in An Spidéal and in Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge in An Cheathrú Rua in Co Galway.

Bayda will be responsible, in collaboration with the community and organisations in the area, for the implementation of an Irish Language Action Plan that has been prepared for the South Kerry Language Planning Area.

Bayda said that his appointment was “a privilege and an honour” for the “picturesque” area of south Kerry.

“I am extremely grateful for the warm welcome I have received over the past few days and I am looking forward to starting to work with the community to promote not only the Irish Language but the area itself also.

The second row is set to be fully fit to feature for Andy Farrell’s side in a busy schedule of Tests this autumn.

On Monday, Leinster had reported that Ireland lock Ryan would be out of action for 10 to 12 weeks after suffering a shoulder injury in pre-season training.

That timeline would have meant Ryan missing the conclusion of Leinster’s 2019/20 season, including their European quarter-final clash with Sarries at the Aviva Stadium on 19 September and any further knock-out games if the province progressed.

However, Cullen clarified yesterday that Ryan has already completed around half of that recovery timeframe and is therefore in line for a return to fitness in September.

That means Ryan is also set to be firing again in time for Ireland’s rescheduled Six Nations fixtures against Italy and France in October, as well as their ‘Eight Nations’ games in November and December.

“We were back for a block [of pre-season training] and he got injured in that first block and we took a break,” explained Cullen at an event to support AsIAm, Ireland’s National Autism Charity & Advocacy Organisation.

“He had a procedure straight away but he is well on his way, so I’m not sure exactly is he maybe five or six weeks in, I’d have to check that exactly… I think five.

“He is making really good progress, he is flying it. He’s running and lifting in the gym, so making good progress.”

Ryan’s swift recovery so far is a real boost for Leinster and Ireland ahead of what will be a hectic schedule of rugby in the coming months.

Taoiseach says he 'understands concerns' as ministers question Ireland 2040 marketing,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR says that he “understands” concerns around the promotion of the Project Ireland 2040 plan.

Questions have been raised about how advertorials in newspapers have been presented during the €1.5 million rollout of the plan.

The government’s controversial Strategic Communications Unit is heading up a sweeping strategy to promote the plan across traditional and online media.

The Ireland edition of The Times has reported that regional newspapers were directed by an ad agency to ensure the ads appeared as regular news items.

The fallout from the controversy led to concerns at Cabinet, as Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone, Transport Minister Shane Ross and Communications Minister Denis Naughten all raising it with the Taoiseach. Zappone said that public money should not be used to promote Oireachtas candidates.

Speaking to RTÉ’s News At One, Varadkar said he’d spoken to all three over the last 24 hours to allay their fears. Varadkar said that only two of the pieces featured people who were not current Oireachtas members.

“I should say that there were 160 advertorials in papers, all clearly labelled. There were only two which featured non-Oireachtas members – one is a Sinn Féin councillor and another is a pic of a Fianna Gael councillor standing beside Michael Ring.

I appreciate the concerns that have been raised. I agree public money should never be used to promote Oireachtas candidates and that there shouldn’t be a blurring of lines. Guidelines were issued to ensure that didn’t happen, but it’s evident that those guidelines need to be strengthened and I will do that but now the focus is severe weather.

Ireland's newest centenarian shares secrets to long life while celebrating 100th birthday,"IRELAND’S NEWEST CENTENARIAN says regular porridge consumption and walking is the secret to living a long-life.

Margaret Lynch was born in the Rotunda hospital in Dublin on 3 April, 1920. She celebrated her 100th birthday at her home in Walkinstown today, surrounded, in a socially distant manner, by her family and friends.

The Dubliner was born in the midst of the Irish War of Independence and her milestone birthday comes as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the globe.

Margaret spoke to Joe Duffy on RTÉ Radio One’s Liveline today and recounted some of the remarkable times she lived through.

World War II was still dragging on when she got married in July 1945 and she had to collect food coupons for the day’s festivities as rationing was in force in Ireland:

We were still on rations. I had to borrow food coupons from family and friends. Lived through it all.

Margaret told Duffy that they burned their ration books when the harsh measure was finally relaxed but she now regrets not keeping hers as a souvenir.

The 100-year-old is the last surviving pupil of her school and she received her Centenarian Bounty today, which includes €2,540 and a congratulatory letter from President Michael D Higgins.

As well as being a great-grandmother to 28, a grandmother to 15 and a mother to six, she is also the Sisters of Charity’s longest serving volunteer, having helped the religious institution for 54 years.

Margaret’s appearence on the radio show sparked an outpouring of reaction with floods of callers phoning in to wish her a happy birthday.

When asked for the secret to her long life, Lynch offered a simple formula:

Keep eating your porridge. Go for walks. That’s about it.

The 100-year-old, who lives by herself, has been keeping busy during the pandemic, planting seeds and spuds in her garden. She says her real party is merely “postponed” until the crisis has passed.

Baird received a red card in Saturday’s defeat to Australia for a high tackle on out-half Will Harrison. The Leinster lock flew out of Ireland’s defensive line in the 21st minute to hit the Junior Wallabie, but connected with his head.

Referee Christopher Ridley decided that there was a ‘high level of force and danger’ involved after consulting his TMO, said he had ‘no choice’ but to hand Baird his marching orders while 14-man Ireland went on to suffer a 45-17 defeat.

The player appeared at a hearing before an independent World Rugby Disciplinary Committee chaired by José Luis Rolandi [Argentina], along with Stefan Terblanche [former South African player] and Valeriu Toma [former Romanian referee], in Rosario.

And there was good news for Noel McNamara’s men as he walked free.

Arsenal boss Arteta makes full recovery from Covid-19,"The 37-year-old say he is feeling 'very well'.

The 37-year-old say he is feeling 'very well'.

ARSENAL BOSS MIKEL Arteta says he has now fully recovered from coronavirus.

The 37-year-old tested positive for the virus 10 days ago, just before the Premier League postponed all its fixtures.

Players and staff at Arsenal have been self-isolating since Arteta was diagnosed, but the Spaniard believes he is now back to full health.

I’m very well now, I feel that I have recovered,” Arteta told Spanish television channel La Sexta.

“It took me three or four days to start feeling much better and with more energy, to leave the symptoms behind, and now the truth is that I feel very well.”

Arteta self-isolated after coming into contact with Olympiacos president Evangelos Marinakis, who subsequently tested positive, during Arsenal’s recent Europa League clash.

“Everything happened very fast,” added Arteta. “On Tuesday afternoon I was feeling so-so and I went to see the doctor but he wasn’t there.

“I got a call from the board of directors after training while I was in my car and they told me the president of Olympiacos had tested positive and everyone who had been in contact was at risk.

Enjoy saunas? New research finds they significantly lower risk of stroke,"FREQUENT SAUNAS ARE associated with a reduced risk of stroke, according to a new international study.

It found that people taking a sauna four to seven times a week were 61% less likely to suffer a stroke than those taking a sauna once a week.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. This is the first prospective large-scale study on this topic, and the findings were reported in Neurology.

According to the researchers, the association of sauna bathing with reduced stroke may include a reduction in blood pressure, stimulation of immune system, a positive impact on the autonomic nervous system and an improved cardiovascular function.

The study involved 1,628 men and women aged 53 to 74 who live in the eastern part of Finland.

The study participants were divided into three groups – those taking a sauna once a week, those taking a sauna two to three times a week and those taking a sauna four to seven times a week.

The more frequently saunas were taken, the lower the risk of stroke was.

The risk among those taking two or three sessions a week decreased by 14% compared to those taking just one sauna a week, while it reduced to 61% among those who took four to seven sessions a week.

The study found that the association persisted even when taking into account stroke risk factors such as age, sex, diabetes, body mass index, blood lipids, alcohol consumption, physical activity and socio-economic status.

Lead researcher Dr Setor Kunutsor from Bristol Medical School said:

The findings are very significant and highlight the multiple health benefits of taking frequent sauna baths.

The findings are based on the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) study.

The KIHD study is an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study designed to investigate risk factors for cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis and related outcomes in middle-aged men from eastern Finland, the population with one of the highest recorded rates of coronary heart disease.

Previous results from the KIHD study at the University of Eastern Finland have shown that frequent sauna bathing also significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

The reduced risk associated with sauna bathing was found by a team of scientists from the Universities of Eastern Finland, Bristol, Leicester, Emory, Cambridge and Innsbruck.",https://www.thejournal.ie/sauna-stroke-study-3993020-May2018/,the_journal,1
"Stevenson awake and healing, says girlfriend","FORMER WORLD CHAMPION Adonis Stevenson is “awake” and healing from the injury suffered in a loss at the start of the month, according to his girlfriend.

The 41-year-old underwent surgery following a knockout loss to Ukrainian Oleksandr Gvozdyk in Quebec City on 1 December.

Stevenson, who lost his WBC and lineal light-heavyweight titles, was said to be in a medically induced coma after the fight.

In a statement released on Saturday, his girlfriend – Simone God – said Stevenson was recovering.

“Despite recent reports being leaked to media, I wanted to clarify that Adonis is awake,” she said.

“He is healing from his injury in the private company of his family and his dedicated medical team.

“Adonis is a world champion in the ring and is exhibiting that same grit, strength and determination in his recovery.

“Adonis and our family are so thankful to you all for your love and support and respectfully ask to continue to grant Adonis and our family privacy as he heals from his accident.

“With the holidays here, Adonis is spending time enjoying music and spending time with Adonia and his family and sends his love and appreciation to you all.”

Dr Cillian De Gascun at the nightly briefing in the Department of Health.

MORE THAN 9,000 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Ireland have now recovered, official figures indicate.

Statistics from the Department of Health show that 8,377 people have recovered in the community while 856 of those in hospital have also recovered.

The figures, which are the most up to date available, are based on an analysis of the confirmed cases when the overall total stood at 15,186 on Saturday.

The number of confirmed infections had risen to 16,040 yesterday, with 388 new cases confirmed in the previous 24 hours.

Yesterday marked the first time the department outlined statistics in relation to recoveries.

Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the figures were broadly in line with recovery rates in other countries.

“It’s giving us a picture which is probably similar to what our understanding, our expectation, might have been,” he said.

Dr Cillian De Gascun, the chairman of the Covid-19 expert advisory group, said as of midnight on Monday, 111,584 tests for coronavirus had been carried out.

He said 20,822 tests were carried out in the previous seven days. Of those, 4,025 were positive (19%).

He said the current turnaround time for results was 24 to 36 hours. He added that capacity for testing stood at 10,000 a day but the number of referrals for testing was only between 1,300 to 1,500 per day.

He said the excess capacity would be deployed to manage a planned upturn in testing in community residential settings.

“It doesn’t surprise us in terms of what we might have expected, and some of the figures that we would have had all along about our hospitalisation rates, our admission rates into intensive care, would be suggesting that we’re having an experience of the disease which is consistent with the international picture.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/testing-recovering-covid-19-recovered-coronavirus-5080707-Apr2020/,the_journal,1

The Citywest centre was set up to ease pressure on hospitals in Dublin and surrounding areas, receiving its first patients earlier this month.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle promote ‘good news’ Instagram account,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex with their baby son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor in May.

THE DUKE AND Duchess of Sussex are promoting an Instagram account about positive news worldwide in a bid to highlight inspiring stories throughout the new year.

Harry and Meghan have chosen to “shine a light” on @goodnews_movement, which “focuses and celebrates acts of kindness” worldwide.

In a post on Instagram, the couple wrote: “Happy New Year! For 2020 we will be continuing our tradition of highlighting accounts that inspire, and that remind us of all the good that is happening in the world.”

It continued: “This journalist run-page covers and celebrates acts of kindness and good news in our global community. We hope it brings you joy!”

Founded by Michelle Figueroa, the Boston Correspondent for Spanish-language news channel CNN en Espanol, the uplifting news account showcases “kind acts”, “good news” and “community heroes” to its more than 190,000 followers.

In the Good News Movement Facebook page, she said: “I created the good news with the mission to share good news with people who are constantly inundated with bad news (it seems like a lot of us).

“Bad news can drain and exhaust us – conversely, good news uplifts and motivates us.”

One recent post detailed how American bus company Greyhound gave free tickets to young runaways wishing to return home.

In another, a caretaker in a children’s hospital cheered up young patients by helping them share their love of Lego creations.

The royal couple are currently only following this account on their official Instagram and plan to focus on one “inspiring” account each month.

Son Archie

Their latest post came after they shared an Instagram compilation summarising their 2019 which included a new image of their seven-month-old son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. In the photograph, Harry is cuddling baby Archie.

The royals have had a turbulent year, with the high point being the arrival of baby Archie on 6 May weighing 7lb 3oz.

Two days later baby Archie was introduced to the world at a photocall in the Castle’s St George’s Hall, with Meghan declaring: “It’s magic, it’s pretty amazing. I have the two best guys in the world so I’m really happy.”

Archie is not entitled to a ‘His Royal Highness’ title nor is he a prince. Harry and Meghan chose not to use the courtesy title Earl Dumbarton, which Archie was allowed to use, nor to style him Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.

Their 2019 also had lows, which included rows over privacy, alleged rifts with relatives, and the launch of legal action against a number of British newspapers over alleged phone hacking and the publishing of one of Meghan’s private letters.

In October, Harry issued a statement criticising the British tabloid media and setting out his fears for his wife following a “relentless” campaign against her by some sections of the press.

Referencing press coverage of his late mother Princess Diana, the duke said his “deepest fear is history repeating itself”.

“I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.

NFL concussions show big drop after rule changes,"CONCUSSIONS IN THE NFL dropped by nearly 30% this season in the wake of rule changes designed to make the game safer, the league confirmed on Thursday.

Figures reported on the NFL’s website showed that the number of diagnosed concussion cases in regular season games fell from 190 in 2017 to 135 in 2018, a 29 percent decrease.

With concussions from pre-season games included, the number dropped from 281 in 2017 to 214 in 2018.

The sharp drop in concussions comes after the NFL introduced new rules this year, making it illegal for players to initiate contact with the helmet when tackling or being tackled.

The league also tweaked rules relating to kick offs and punt returns, with the goal of reducing the number of high-speed collisions.

The NFL were cautious, however, on whether the fall-off in concussion numbers could be definitively attributed to the rule changes.

“We’re certainly pleased with the progress on concussion reduction,” Jeff Miller, the NFL’s executive vice president for health and safety, said. “There is a lot more work to do.”

NFL medical officials will sift through the data gleaned from the 2018 season in the coming weeks to attempt to pinpoint causes for the reduced number.

The NFL meanwhile has continued to encourage more advanced helmets, with certain kinds set to be phased out altogether as of next season.

League officials also carry out more concussion evaluations on the sidelines than ever before.

This year 538 players were evaluated for concussion although 75 percent of those cases came back without diagnosis of concussion.

“We continue to emphasise an extremely conservative approach,” said Allen Sills, the NFL’s chief medical officer.

“If they even suspect someone is concussed, we screen that player.”

The NFL has faced growing scrutiny in recent years over the issue of concussions and head trauma in the sport.

In 2015, the league agreed to a $1 billion settlement to resolve thousands of lawsuits by former players suffering from neurological problems.

All-Ireland semi switch-up means nightmare clash avoided for Cork dual stars,"CORK’S ALL-IRELAND SENIOR football championship semi-final has been switched to 25 August, alleviating a nightmare fixture clash for dual players.

Cork dual players Libby Coppinger and Hannah Looney.

Their last four clash against Donegal and the camogie side’s All-Ireland semi-final date with Tipperary were both penciled in for 18 August leaving Libby Coppinger and Hannah Looney in an awkward situation.

Key players to both sides, Coppinger and Looney luckily no longer have to tog out for two inter-county fixtures in one day — or make a big decision.

Last month, the Ladies Gaelic Football Association (LGFA) and Camogie Association released a joint statement highlighting the potential clash, confirming that both would stick to their plans because of TV coverage.

But the LGFA have this afternoon released another statement confirming that both of their All-Ireland senior championship semi-finals will take place on Saturday, 25 August.

Ephie Fitzgerald’s Cork go head-to-head with Ulster champions Donegal at 2.45pm while the winners of the remaining quarter-final fixtures — Dublin v Kerry and Mayo v Galway — will face off at 4.30pm.

“The LGFA flagged the potential of a dual clash involving Cork a number of weeks ago,” they wrote. “And that came to pass when the county’s footballers qualified for the All-Ireland semi-final, which was scheduled for August 18.

“In light of this, the LGFA carefully reviewed arrangements and worked extremely hard behind the scenes in recent days to find a compromise.”

Paudie Murray’s camogie side meet Tipperary with an All-Ireland final spot on the line as part of a Semple Stadium double-header on 18 August (throw-in 7.15pm).

Here’s the full statement the LGFA released this afternoon, with comment from their CEO Helen O’Rourke:

“The Ladies Gaelic Football Association can confirm the following arrangements for the forthcoming TG4 All-Ireland intermediate and senior semi-finals.

“Tyrone will play Sligo in the first of the 2018 TG4 All-Ireland intermediate semi-finals on Saturday, August 18.

“A week later, Saturday August 25 at 1pm, the second intermediate semi-final will be played, featuring the winners of the Clare v Meath and Roscommon v Laois quarter-final fixtures, which are down for decision tomorrow (August 11).

“The LGFA is also in a position to confirm that both senior championship semi-finals will now be played on Saturday, August 25 at 2.45pm and 4.30pm.

“Cork will play Donegal at 2.45pm and the winners of the remaining quarter-final fixtures – Dublin v Kerry and Galway v Mayo – will feature in the other semi-final at 4.30pm.

“The LGFA flagged the potential of a dual clash involving Cork a number of weeks ago, and that came to pass when the county’s footballers qualified for the All-Ireland semi-final, which was scheduled for August 18.

“In light of this, the LGFA carefully reviewed arrangements and worked extremely hard behind the scenes in recent days to find a compromise.

“LGFA CEO Helen O’Rourke commented: “We announced the times and dates of our summer fixtures schedule last March, when it was clearly stated that our All-Ireland senior semi-finals would be played on August 18 and August 25.

“We stated at the time that finding suitable times for our televised fixtures proved extremely challenging, and that we felt restricted to a large degree, due to the GAA’s new, condensed fixtures schedule.

“When Cork qualified for the TG4 All-Ireland senior semi-final last weekend, a dual fixtures clash arose but, as an Association, we took it upon ourselves to find a solution suitable to all parties.

Greats news for our duel players. Thanks to everyone for yer support!! It’s been immense 👍🏼 — James Masters (@mastersja) August 10, 2018 Source: James Masters /Twitter

“It should be noted at this point that altering a fixtures schedule so late in the season has a significant knock-on effect and impact on club and county players in other counties, and that we had to negotiate a number of logistical and contractual issues on this occasion before arriving at this solution.

“It should also be pointed out that personal plans relating to some individuals, around previously confirmed holiday arrangements and family occasions, were also considered and factored into exhaustive discussions with various stakeholders.

“We would like to thank Donegal for agreeing to play their semi-final a week later, on August 25, and to our championship sponsors and broadcast partners TG4, who have had to revise a number of plans to accommodate this change.

“We would like to wish all of our counties competing in the senior, intermediate and junior championships the very best of luck for the remainder of their respective campaigns, and we look forward to seeing big crowds present for the games between now and finals day on September 16 at Croke Park.”

"Almost €550,000 donated to grassroots fundraiser Feed The Heroes in 2 weeks","A GRASSROOTS FUNDRAISING effort to provide frontline healthcare workers with nutritious meals has raised over €550,000 in just two weeks.

Through the Feed The Heroes initiative, more than 18,500 meals have been delivered nationwide to staff at the Covid-19 Testing Centres, HSE Contact Tracing, the National Ambulance Service and the Fire Brigade as well as hospital workers.

Feed The Heroes partners with restaurants and takeaways, caterers and commercial kitchens to prepare and deliver the meals and co-ordinates with the frontline teams to ensure they get to where they are needed.

More than 11,000 individual donations have been made over the two weeks.

The Feed the Heroes organisers said that the meals are also “a simple way of showing solidarity and gratitude to Ireland’s critical frontline workers who are working long shifts in very challenging circumstances as they combat Ireland’s biggest ever public health emergency”.

There is now a team of twenty volunteers and an advisory board co-coordinating the Feed The Heroes effort with the intention of sustaining the meal delivery through the Covid-19 emergency. Each meal costs approximately €7 to prepare and deliver.

If you want to contribute, you can do so here. Corporate donations can be made by contacting corporatedonations@feedtheheroes.com. Find more information is here.

Speaking today, Feed The Heroes fund founder, Cian O’Flaherty said that they had been “completely blown away by the response of the Irish people”.

“They have transformed what began as an ambition to raise €1,000 to buy a few meals into a national operation that to date has delivered more than 18,500 meals to critical frontline workers nationwide.

More than 11,300 Irish people have contributed to Feed The Heroes from a seven-year-old donating €5 of their pocket-money to a €20,000 donation from Republic of Ireland international and Everton football player, Seamus Coleman.

“Every single euro makes a difference and we take the responsibility entrusted to us by all our donors very seriously.

“The meals are greatly appreciated by those who receive them not just for the food itself but also for what it represents – a symbol of our solidarity with and gratitude to those combating Ireland’s biggest ever public health emergency.”

'This is a great news day for Castletroy': Limerick selected as base for 600 jobs,"A US COMPANY which announced in March that it would be bringing 600 jobs to Ireland has selected Limerick as its new base.

Edwards Lifesciences – a medtech company which develops technologies and therapies to help treat people with heart disease – is investing €80 million to build a new purpose-built manufacturing facility in Castletroy.

Once completed in 2021, the facility will manufacture delivery components for its transcatheter heart valve therapies.

Fine Gael Senator Kieran O’Donnell said that the announcement was a “great news day for Limerick City and Castletroy”.

The company said that the main attraction for it to invest in Ireland was the “wealth of experienced talent available”, and thanked the government and IDA for its support.

While the majority of jobs won’t be in place until 2021, over 60 staff – in production, engineering and professional management – are expected to be employed at Edwards Lifesciences’ initial site in the Shannon Free Zone, which opened in August.

Jack is pictured with some of his cards and parcels.

A BOY WITH a rare disease, who had to cancel his birthday party due to Covid-19, has had over 1,000 cards posted to him after his mother made an appeal for people to mail him.

Ruth Beattie asked people to send cards to her son Jack, who is (9) tomorrow, after his party had to be called off.

It would have been his first party in three years – the last two years he was not able to have one as a result of having surgery related to having Osteogenesis Imperfacta or brittle bone disease.

Ruth said it broke her heart when she had to tell him his party this year could not go ahead and instead she appealed for people to post him birthday cards.

“The response has been unbelievable,” she said.

The latest count has over 1,000 cards, including one for Ruth, and some have come from as far away as France and Switzerland as well as Ireland and the UK.

She said the response means he has having “a birthday he will never forget.”

The family live in Raphoe, county Donegal and Ruth said, “We have had cards and parcels from Dublin , Carlow, Mayo, Donegal, Monaghan, Derry and London and that’s not even half of them opened.”

“I’d like to thank each and everyone that took the time to make/send a card/parcel to Jack. It has been a very emotional and overwhelming few days to watch the delight in Jack’s face. This will be a birthday never to forget.”

She said the response has been “Unbelievable. I never imagined this response. I’m actually very emotional this last few days to see everyone come together at such difficult times.”

Ruth had the support of the charity Little Blue Heroes and Jack is an honorary Garda. “Ever since he was made an honorary Garda in January 2018 up in Garda Headquarters, he has the full uniform and goes on duty in Letterkenny Garda Station from time to time,” she said.

“All I can say is this is a birthday Jack will never forget. I had one wish to make him happy and my wish definitely came true.”

She said “thank you” to people from all over the world for what they have done and said, “ I will be forever grateful to each and every one of them.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/jack-beattie-donegal-birthday-cards-5054326-Mar2020/,the_journal,1
The first sign of summer? Loop Head Lighthouse is open to the public again,"Source: Dunphy PR/Clare County Council

LOOP HEAD LIGHTHOUSE is once again open to members of the public.

The popular attraction re-opened during the week, kicking off the tourist season.

Clare County Council, which manages the lighthouse in conjunction with the Commissioner of Irish Lights (CIL), said 27,274 people visited the lighthouse in 2016.

Councillor Bill Chambers, Cathaoirleach of Clare County Council (CCC), said the lighthouse is of huge importance to the community, delivering an estimated €2 million boost to the local economy last year.

“Loop Head Peninsula is one of Ireland’s most scenic and heritage rich locations and I am delighted to see that the lighthouse is playing a central role in growing the sustainable development of the local tourism sector,” Chambers said.

The increase in visitors in 2016 represents the fifth successive annual increase in visitor numbers at the lighthouse.

The building is steeped in history, with its origins dating back to the 1670s.

The existing tower-style lighthouse was constructed in 1854 and was operated and maintained by a keeper who lived within the lighthouse compound. In January 1991, the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation, and today is monitored by the CIL.

The lighthouse will remain open to the public daily until November. More information can be read here.",https://www.thejournal.ie/loop-head-lighthouse-3289456-Mar2017/,the_journal,1
Fair City is having an all-female episode... and they're all heading to the pub,"TONIGHT’S EPISODE OF Fair City is to feature an all-female cast to mark International Women’s Day.

In a first for the RTÉ soap, no men will feature in an episode with about a dozen female cast members sharing the screen time.

The premise sees the women locked in McCoy’s pub with RTÉ saying that “the cocktails flow” as the night progresses.

“We have been planning this for a long time,” executive producer Brigie deCourcy told Morning Ireland.

We worked out about six months ago that we had a range of storylines that were being driven by women. So we thought it’d be great fun to have them all collide on the one night.

DeCourcy says the plot has been “slightly orchestrated” to get all the women in the same place but that the episode will see a number of storylines coming to a head.

“There are no men, they are off looking after the babies or they’re taking a little holiday or they’re at the other end of the phone, and we have about 11 or 12 of our really strong female characters fighting it out,”

So there’ll be slaps and there’ll be secrets and there’ll be lies and there’ll be reveals and there’ll be lots of dancing.

As part of further shows based around International Women’s Day, RTÉ will also broadcast an hour-long documentary tomorrow called Women on Walls.

The programme focuses on the first four female members of the Royal Irish Academy as well as eight living female scientist in the fields of science, technology, engineering and maths.",https://www.thejournal.ie/her-come-the-fair-city-girls-3276249-Mar2017/,the_journal,1
"A half-skull that is 400,000 years old was found on last day of excavation project","THE DISCOVERY OF a 400,000-year-old half skull in Portugal has offered tantalising hints about a possible ancestor of the Neanderthals, researchers said this week.

Source: PNAS.org

The original completely restored Aroeira 3 cranium in lateral view (A) and the virtual reconstruction and original fossil in inferior view (B)

The fossil was unearthed from the Aroeira cave site, and marks the oldest human cranium fossil ever found in the country, according to a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed US journal.

But there is plenty of mystery around the skull.

Researchers don’t know if it was from a male or female, how the person died, or even what form of early human it was.

“There is a lot of question about which species these fossils represent. I tend to think of them as ancestors of the Neanderthals,” co-author Rolf Quam, an anthropologist at Binghamton University, State University of New York, told AFP.

“It is not a Neanderthal itself,” he added.

“It has some features that might be related to the later Neanderthals,” including a lump of bone near the ear called the mastoid process.

Researchers say this bone may be related to regulating pressure in the ear, although its exact purpose is unclear.

What researchers can say with certainty is that the skull belonged to an adult, based on the formation of the bones. A couple of teeth found with it appear worn, as if belonging to an adult rather than a child.

Source: PNAS.org

(A and B) The Aroeira 1 left mandibular canine (A) and the Aroeira 2 left maxillary third molar (B) in mesial (Mes), distal (Dist), buccal (Bucc), and lingual view (Ling). (C) Aroeira 3 maxilla in medial view. Arrows indicate the lateral nasal crest (1), turbinal crest (2); nasal floor (3), and root of the inferior nasal concha (4).

They also know its age – 400,000 years – based on precision dating of the surrounding stalagmites and sediments.

The same cannot be said for other skulls of its kind found elsewhere in Europe. Some were uncovered years ago, before modern technology existed. In other cases, conditions at the cave site did not allow for precise dating of surrounding rock and sediment.

Researchers have sometimes had to guess at the ages of these skulls, ranging from 200,000 to more than 400,000 years, according to Quam.

The Portuguese skull shares some features with bones uncovered in northern Spain that are some 430,000 years old, and in southern France dating even further back, to around 450,000 years.

“There is a lot of debate currently in the anthropological literature about what species to call these fossils. There is not a lot of agreement,” said Quam, who co-authored the study with Portuguese archaeologist Joao Zilhao and colleagues.

- Stone tools -

Its location is the furthest west of any human fossil ever found in Europe during the middle Pleistocene period.

It is also one of the earliest in Europe to be associated with the Acheulean stone tool industry, a more advanced kind of toolkit than used among the earliest humans in Europe.

The Acheulean stone tools included tear-drop-shaped hand-axes that were more complex to build than previous iterations.

They originated in Africa and probably made their way into Europe via the Middle East around 500,000 years ago.

#Open journalism No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you Support us now

To find evidence of these tools 400,000 years ago, all the way over in western Europe, “means relatively quickly the Acheuleans spread through Europe,” Quam said.

- Almost missed -

While there remains much to be learned about the skull, researchers feel lucky that they found it at all. In fact, they almost missed it.

Glimpsed as an outline of a skull in sediment as hard as cement, the skull was found on the last day of an excavation project in 2014.

“I have been studying these sites for the last 30 years and we have recovered much important archaeological data. But the discovery of a human cranium of this antiquity and importance is always a very special moment,” said Zilhao in a statement.

Source: PNAS.org

Workers toiled for a week to cut a block out of the Earth. At one point, a heavy duty demolition hammer broke the skull into pieces.

It took two and a half years to painstakingly extract the skull itself from the block.

Images of the skull show a circular hole, which represents the damage incurred during the excavation.

The fossil will go on display in October at the Museu Nacional de Arqueologia in Lisbon.

In the coming years, experts will dive into the details of the skull and its surroundings “to give a more complete picture of life in the area, life in the cave and the evolutionary place of this human in our ancestry,” said Quam.

EU teens one step closer to being handed free interrailing ticket on their 18th birthdays,"TEENAGERS ACROSS EUROPE are closer to receiving a free interrailing voucher on their 18th birthday after a vote in the European Parliament passed.

The idea, spearheaded by Manfred Weber, leader of Fine Gael’s EPP group, would mean EU citizens would receive free pass to travel the trainlines of the continent.

Weber is requesting that the European Commission funds and launches an initiative whereby 18-year-olds are gifted a single use interrail ticket for their birthday.

The programme would be funded by the European Commission in cooperation with member states and rail companies.

Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond welcomed the vote in the European Parliament which confirmed its priorities for the 2018 EU Budget. Included in this set of priorities was the interrailing initiative.

“This vote is just the first document that parliament produces in the annual budget procedure. It sets out the line that parliament expects the commission to take when drawing up its budget proposals and any proposal included in this is certainly a promising beginning.

“As a student, I was very fortunate to travel across Europe on an interrailing ticket and it was that experience that plays such a large part in my belief in the greatness of the European project and the importance that, particularly now in the wake of Brexit, we fight for the survival and continuing strengthening of the EU,” Richmond said.

Interrailing is a common holiday option for Europeans and involves getting trains around Europe from place to place over a period of time.

Typically, a person buys a single multi-use ticket which they can to take trains all around Europe.",https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-budget-interrailing-ticket-birthday-18-3296574-Mar2017/,the_journal,1
'Irish people have a hunger to make a difference in the world',"The 2016 Global Citizen Awards Ceremony Source: Jorge Ruiz Villasante/GCA

IRELAND HAS A strong tradition of people volunteering abroad, something that stretches back decades.

Many changes have happened nationally and internationally in the 53 years that EIL Intercultural Learning has been in operation, but its goal has remained the same.

The non-profit organisation based in Cork aims to bring different cultures together through various volunteering and study abroad programmes.

In 2016, EIL teamed up with similar organisations and charities, such as UCD Volunteers Overseas, Suas, Development Perspectives and Serve, to develop the Global Citizen Award (GCA).

The GCA aims to recognise the work done by volunteers abroad and also encourages them to stay involved with social justice issues once they return to Ireland.

Kevin Hickey, CEO of EIL Ireland, says the awards “build on the very strong tradition of volunteering abroad that has been in Ireland for several generations”.

“In general, Irish people have a hunger to a make a difference in the world.

What we found in EIL was that when people return to Ireland after volunteering abroad, they often come back quite deflated and feel like there is so much more that they should do but are not sure how.

“The GCA helps them to give a voice to the people they met when volunteering abroad.”

Kevin Hickey Source: EIL Ireland

By holding events or workshops about their experiences when they return home, volunteers raise awareness in their local community about issues such as poverty, gender-based violence, HIV and climate change.

Hickey says this is an important aspect of the GCA as it “puts the human face on statistics that sometimes we read about in the paper but get immune to”, adding: “It gives people a real opportunity to commit to making a difference.”

Some 28 people will receive awards at the GCA ceremony in Dublin city today – gold, silver and bronze. As well as volunteering abroad, gold winners also commit to volunteering for a minimum of 40 hours once they return to Ireland.

Rise in nationalism

Hickey says intercultural experiences are more important now than ever given the rise of nationalist views highlighted in the wake of Brexit, Donald Trump’s election in the US and the rise in popularity of Marine Le Pen in France.

“People have been quite shocked I think about Brexit and Trump and what’s currently unfolding in the French presidential election as well … it’s a wake-up call for people.

“It’s so worrying, this move towards nationalism and introspection. That did so much terrible damage to our country in the ’30, ’40s, ’50s and ’60s, which led to bleeding emigration.

It’s really worrying that people are not learning from history, we need to look back on history and not repeat the same mistakes.

“People have begun to realise that you just can’t sit back and let things happen … The most effective changes in history happened when individuals made small changes, but together they made a huge difference,” Hickey said.

Social activism and young people

Ciaran Boyle will be receiving a gold GCA today. He volunteered with Suas Educational Development as a primary school teaching assistant in Noida, near Delhi in India.

Boyle (23) said the GCA helped him to stay focused on social justice issues when he returned to Ireland.

“It’s good to have that kind of tangible aim when you come back. You might come home thinking ‘I’m going to save the world’, but it’s a lot easier said than done.”

Boyle is involved with the Glass Wall, an initiative by students from Trinity and the National College of Art and Design that focuses on social activism.

“A lot of young Irish people are apathetic when it comes to social justice issues and politics, we’re trying to bridge that gap. We’re trying to be engaging and accessible to young people in Ireland,” Boyle said.

He and other members of the Suas Society at Trinity College also set up a weekly class with students from St Mary’s secondary school in Crumlin to teach them about global development issues such as poverty, global warming and gender equality.

Ciaran Source: Ciaran Boyle

Boyle said the classes aim to teach teenagers about important topics they often haven’t come across before.

We believe that these are really important topics that you need to teach in school … There’s somewhat of a blissful ignorance to these kinds of problems in Ireland.

One of the classes focused on child trafficking in southeast Asia. “They were shocked by that, to many of them trafficking was this abstract thing you might see in a movie, but not in real life,” Boyle said.

He added that the classes are as creative as possible to engage students and lead to “open discussion and learning”.

The pupils are taught about how they can make a difference through personal actions such as recycling or raising awareness through talking to others about what they’ve learned.

Later this year, Suas Trinity hopes to extend these classes to other schools.

Rome's 'baldy' Christmas tree is being made into a family hut and souvenirs,"Source: SIPA USA/PA Images

ROME’S CHRISTMAS TREE, nicknamed “baldy” and ridiculed for its mangy, wilted branches, is being immortalised in the form of wooden furniture and souvenirs.

The Norway spruce is to be recycled into a wooden hut where mothers can breastfeed and children can play, Rome city council said.

The Eternal City’s tree was affectionately nicknamed “Spelacchio”, which translates as ‘mangy’ or ‘baldy’, after being declared dead on its arrival in Rome from northern Italy in December.

It was slammed an international embarrassment, and some compared it to a toilet brush.

But it gained such a fan base that the capital promised to save it from the chipper.

The tree will be given a new life as “a comfortable wooden house with a table where mothers can change their babies, a seat for breastfeeding and a playtable for young ones,” the council said in a statement.

Some of the wood will also be used to make souvenirs, it said.

“We want to make this international star a concrete example of creative recycling, because everything can have a second life,” mayor Virginia Raggi was quoted as saying.

The tree – which was estimated to have cost the city some €48,000 – was described by many as a metaphor for the state of the capital.

In a bizarre step, workers began dismantling the spindly giant, before apparently receiving orders to decorate it again after the deadline to remove it was pushed back.

Tomorrow is set to be warm and mostly dry with sunny spells and highs of 24 degrees. Any showers in the morning are expected to clear by midday.

Saturday looks much the same. Met Eireann says, “The best of the sunshine is likely to be over Leinster, east Ulster, Munster and east Connacht.”

Sunday is due to be another warm and mainly dry day with some cloudy periods. Temperatures are set to be in the low twenties in sunshine.

Heavy traffic

AA Rescue is warning drivers that hot summer weather can cause problems for cars.It’s expecting an increase in breakdowns caused by over heating or tyre issues.

Director of Consumer Affairs Conor Faughnan said, “Hot weather can make life hard for a driver.”

Harsh sunlight and glare can make it difficult to see vulnerable road users. We know that a weekend like this will see lots of kids out and about, cyclists taking to the roads and a general increase in traffic volumes. It all adds to the danger so the advice is to slow down and expect the unexpected.

Heavy traffic is expected to parks, mountain walks and beaches this weekend so drivers are advised to allow a bit more time and to expect crowds.

Faughnan added that crashes due to glare on windscreens are also quite common and that it’s important to make sure that both the inside and outside of the windscreen are properly cleaned.

“Checking that you have plenty of water for your windscreen wipers and washer fluid are also essential as dead insects or dust from roads may make their way on to windscreens, causing visibility issues. Remember to keep a pair of sunglasses handy too.”

AA is warning that sunshine is also a significant factor in driver fatigue, especially if motorists are driving long distances or feeling tired.

The advice is to keep well hydrated and if necessary, drink two cups of coffee and have a short nap of about 20 minutes.",https://www.thejournal.ie/sunshine-weekend-weather-3446434-Jun2017/,the_journal,1

IF YOU’RE TIRED of the Luas works, here’s some news to cheer you up.

After four years of construction, the work is almost finished, and the Luas Cross City project have released an updated map to include the new Luas line – coloured in blue above.

It lists 13 new stops: Broombridge, Cabra, Phibsborough, Grangegorman, Broadstone, Dominick, O’Connell Upper, O’Connell GPO, Parnell, Marlborough, Trinity, Westmoreland and Dawson.

That means the new Luas tram will give greater access to three of Dublin’s four main universities: Trinity College, DIT, and DCU.

Once the project is complete, you won’t have to change trams if travelling from Brides Glen to Broombridge – meaning the green line tram won’t stop at Stephen’s Green (currently the most northern stop on the green line) and will continue on to Bloombridge.

The new route will be called the green line once it’s complete, the blue colour just indicates the new tracks and stops.

Construction work is ongoing with latest road disruptions to affect Dawson Street, Anne Street South, Duke Street and Duke Lane for the next two months.

The two Longford women, Grainne Brady from Shannonorchard.com and Jasmine Elkhershi from Procrastimake.com, received a certificate of distinction for their fairy garden and trail in the postcard garden section at Bloom this year.

The garden, called the Magic of Kindness, is about how “the smallest acts of kindness can create magic in someone’s day”.

The garden, sponsored by Ardcarne Garden Centre, features fairy houses, a wishing well and a fairy trail. A wishing chair was artfully crafted by the maintenance team at the hospital and added to the garden, and the Longford Irish Countrywomen’s Association craft class made the fairy doors for a ‘fairy hotel’.

Craft blogger Jasmine says she got the idea of installing the garden in the hospital grounds because her friend’s daughter, who is suffering from a rare form of cancer, is treated there.

“We decided to donate the garden to St Therese’s ward to remind the children, who have already dealt with so much, that there is still magic in the world. Really, we just wanted to put a smile on their faces,” she said.

Through their efforts, the pair have also raised €1,132 for the charity Funds for St Therese’s through generous donations at Bloom. The money will be used to redecorate the isolation unit in the ward.

Landscaper Grainne explains, “We had a wishing well in the garden at Bloom and the children kept asking their parents for money to throw in it.

We hadn’t planned that but it just happened and so we donated that money as well. It’s more proof of the Magic of Kindness that’s out there.

The garden has already received a seal of approval from the children who couldn’t wait to explore as the garden was installed, Jasmine said.

“We overheard one child ringing her grandmother and saying ‘I’m on a sleepover in the hospital and there’s fairies everywhere!’ She was so excited, it made it all worthwhile.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/bloom-garden-donated-to-childrens-ward-3493773-Jul2017/,the_journal,1

Barack Obama ends 2017 with a series of 'good news' tweets,"FORMER US PRESIDENT Barack Obama has sent out a series of good news tweets to close off 2017, saying that there was much there to remind people of “what’s best about America”.

In a series of tweets, the former US president referenced a number of different news stories from 2017.

“As we count down to the new year, we get to reflect and prepare for what’s ahead,” Obama began.

“For all the bad news that seemed to dominate our collective consciousness, there are countless stories from this year that remind us what’s best about America.”

This hip hop trio made the best album in Ireland last year,"Rusangano Family beat off some tough competition to scoop the award last night.

Rusangano Family beat off some tough competition to scoop the award last night.

LIMERICK AND SHANNON-based hip hop group Rusangano Family faced down some tough competition to win the RTÉ Choice Music Prize last night.

The African-Irish trio faced down more experienced groups and singers to secure the prize for Irish Album of the Year for their 2016 record Let the Dead Bury the Dead.

The trio – God Knows, Murli, and John Lillis – are based in Limerick and Shannon in Clare.

They secured the prize ahead of more established bands and artists like The Divine Comedy, James Vincent McMorrow and Lisa Hannigan.

Accepting the prize in front of a sold out crowd in Dublin’s Vicar Street last night, the group - who also teach music to children and young adults – thanked their students and everyone who helped them along the way.

The award also comes with a €10,000 cash prize.

The band came together originally as independent artists recording together, before officially forming Rusangano Family in 2015.

They have been regulars on the Irish music scene in recent years, performing at high-profile music festivals and events as well holding their own stand alone concerts.

God Knows and Murli are MCs while Lillis DJ’s, mixing tracks live on stage.

The album Let the Dead Bury Dead explores themes of identity, the experience of being an immigrant, isolation as well as artistic expression and inspiration.

People hadn't set foot in this ancient 'lost city' in the Honduran jungle for 500 years,"MORE THAN HALF a millennium after the collapse of the Mayan civilization, the members of a neighboring Central American society suddenly gathered their most sacred belongings, buried them in the center of town, and vanished.

“There’s a big question about who these people were,” the best-selling author Douglas Preston, who visited the remnants of this city, told Business Insider.

What happened to this civilization? Why did they abandon this city so suddenly?

Preston was part of a research mission launched two years ago to explore the ruins of what is said to be a lost civilization.

He wrote about his recent trip through the Honduran jungle in the new book “The Lost City of the Monkey God: A True Story.”

Some have said that the buried remnants correspond with an ancient, legendary “White City” — a town of extreme wealth that vanished some 600 years ago.

Since the 1900s, rumors of this forgotten city had danced on the lips of explorers, aviators, and tourists excited by the prospect of uncovering hidden treasure. But no one knew much about the people who once lived there.

Even after some parts of an abandoned village, including remnants of plazas and pyramids, were uncovered in 2012, during the first expedition to the area, anthropologists and archaeologists remained stumped.

“In the words of the leading Honduran archaeologist on our expedition, ‘What we know about this culture is … nothing,’” said Preston.

Nevertheless, some intriguing theories have emerged. Researchers on the most recent trip found a cache of nearly 500 intricately carved stone objects inside something Preston described as “a grave not for a person, but for a civilization.”

The legend of the ‘lost city’ and the discovery that made archaeologists fume

The 1,000-year-old ruins — whose timeline coincides with the “White City” — were buried in the rainforest, in a round valley ringed by steep cliffs.

Since a team of researchers uncovered them in 2012, they’ve been revisited by more research teams, including Preston’s.

When news outlets picked up the story, most portrayed it as an ancient mystery that had finally been solved.

National Geographic ran with the headline “Exclusive: Lost City Discovered in the Honduran Rain Forest.” NPR announced “Explorers Discover Ancient Lost City in Honduran Jungle.”

There was one problem, though, according to researchers who signed a public letter condemning the claims in the news: The ruins were not the “lost city” of lore — and worse, they may not have been lost to begin with.

The dissenting researchers — including Chris Begley, an archaeologist at Transylvania University who has 20 years of experience in the region — said the National Geographic story exaggerated the findings and ignored the region’s indigenous people.

National Geographic responded to the letter by linking to a statement from the research team that says its story never claimed to have discovered the “lost city,” but merely a lost city in the region.

The people who disappeared

Controversy notwithstanding, the teams of researchers and documentarians who visited the site in 2012 and 2015 came away riveted by what they’d seen.

Source: Shutterstock/Angela N Perryman

Preston and several other archaeologists maintain that they set foot on terrain that had been untouched for half a millennium. And they say the clues these people left behind point to a tragic end.

“It’s hard to believe that in the 21st century a lost city could still be discovered, but that’s exactly what happened,” he said. “People hadn’t touched foot there in 500 years. It’s absolutely true.”

Whoever populated the area deep in Honduras’ Mosquitia Jungle did not leave many clues. The team that visited in 2012 was able to date the remains it uncovered to somewhere between 1000 AD and 1400 AD.

That places people in the region after the era of the Mayans, whose civilization stretched from southeastern Mexico across Guatemala and Belize and into the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador.

“They grew up near the Mayans. They took on the pyramids. They laid out their cities in a somewhat Mayan fashion, but not quite,” Preston said.

But it’s very mysterious. There’s so much we don’t know.

What researchers do know is that whoever lived there disappeared suddenly. In addition to rough remnants of their pyramids and plazas, they left behind a series of intricate stone pieces, including what is thought to be part of a ceremonial seat featuring an effigy of a “were-jaguar.”

So far, researchers have identified nearly 500 of the stone pieces.

“At the base of a pyramid we discovered an enormous cache of beautiful stone sculptures,” Preston said. “It appears the people brought their objects, carefully laid them to rest, and then walked out of the city.”

Several archaeologists and anthropologists who were on Preston’s research team believe the people were felled by disease.

“The evidence is very strong that that’s what happened,” Preston said. “These were diseases brought by Europeans, specifically smallpox and measles.”

But it’s unlikely that Europeans ever reached this civilization — at least not in person. Instead, the diseases probably found the indigenous populations by way of trade. As goods exchanged hands, so did viruses. And some of these invaders were foreign illnesses against which the indigenous people had no defense.

“This is a fascinating example of how disease can run way ahead of physical contact,” Preston said. “Even though this valley was never physically threatened by the Spanish, it may have been laid low and completely wiped out by their disease.”

'The rescue effort was enormous': Irishman rescued after yacht capsized off Australian coast,"Updated 3:45pm

AN IRISH MAN and French woman have been rescued after a yacht capsized off the Australian coast, as part of what the man’s sister described as an “enormous” effort from emergency services.

Nick Dwyer (55) and Barbara Heftman (44) were on a 40-foot yacht that was travelling from New Zealand to Australia as part of a 10 year-long circumnavigation of the globe.

It happened in the Tasman Sea, on their way to Sydney on Tuesday. They activated an emergency beacon when the yacht “rolled” after the rudder had broken previously in high seas.

It took the rescue boat over 13 hours to get to them. The New South Wales vessel was launched at 7pm on Tuesday and reached the yacht at 8.30am on Wednesday.

NSW police, who took part in the rescue along with seven officers from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, described the conditions as treacherous with six-metre swells and gale-force winds.

Dwyer told reporters,”We encountered enormous seas, waves the size of buildings coming at you constantly, winds that you can’t stand up in, seas breaking, whiteness everywhere.

We weren’t sure whether we were going to be rolled again and each time a wave hit, we thought ‘is the one that’s going to take us?

“It wasn’t really until the low (pressure system) hit us and we got capsized that we felt we really couldn’t survive this one without assistance.”

Dwyer described the rescuers as “absolute heroes”.

The pair told BBC News they will stay in Sydney while figuring out what to do next. Dwyer said:

Our home’s gone, we’re alive, I expect to live a little bit longer and that’ll be okay.

Speaking to RTÉ’s News at One, Dwyer’s sister Sarah Byrne said that the rescue effort undertaken by the Australian authorities was “absolutely enormous”, and hailed it as “extraordinary”.

The whole family are relieved that both Dwyer and Heftman are safe and well, after having to wait all through the night before it was confirmed that both had reached land unharmed.

Dwyer has used the past few hours to catch up on some sleep, but his sister said there was no doubt what his next move would be.

Despite this ordeal, the pair are eager to get back out onto the water, Byrne said.

Absolutely [they're going to continue]. One thing about sailors is that we enjoy a bit of weather, even if that was a bit extreme… Even if they don’t recover [the boat], they’ll still go back out there to live the dream.

ALL 28 JACK Russell terrier dogs and puppies recently given to the ISPCA have been reserved after the charity issued an appeal online.

The ISPCA responded to a call expressing concern for the welfare of 28 dogs on a property recently and found that they had been allowed to breed freely and the number of dogs was spiralling out of control.

The dogs were taken to the National Animal Centre in Longford for veterinary care. The majority of the dogs found were just 18 months old or less, and the group included 17 puppies.

The charity released images of the dogs online last Friday and they gained a huge amount of social media attention.

Speaking to TheJournal.ie this morning, a spokesperson for the ISPCA said:

The ISPCA is delighted all 28 Jack Russell Terrier dogs and puppies recently rescued have all been reserved pending home visits and will be going to their new homes shortly.

All the dogs and puppies at the National Animal Centre are neutered or spayed, micro-chipped, vaccinated and treated for parasites before being responsibly rehomed.

The ISPCA said that the rescue and rehabilitation of such a large number of dogs and puppies places a significant amount of pressure on the ISPCA, both financially and in terms of accommodating such an influx of animals.

In light of the rescue of the large group of Jack Russell terriers, the charity has issued a reminder to pet owners that spaying or neutering “is the kindest thing you can do for your pets”.

“Not only does it bring many positive benefits for both owners and their pets like reducing the risk of certain cancers, curbing unwanted sexual behaviour, marking, but it also improves health and lifespan,” the spokesperson said.

“In the majority of cases, neutering or spaying is the best thing you can do for your pets, so please speak to your vet today.”

Last year, 16,312 calls were made to the National Animal Cruelty Helpline, resulting in over 3,200 investigations. In total, 995 animals were seized or surrendered.

The National Animal Centre in Longford is open every Wednesday to Sunday between 11.30am and 4pm, where visitors can meet the animals in the centre’s care.

"Good news for families: Over 5,000 extra childcare places to be created","Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Children's Minister Katherine Zappone with Saidhbhe O'Loughlin at the launch of the next phase of childcare supports starting next month.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Children's Minister Katherine Zappone with Saidhbhe O'Loughlin at the launch of the next phase of childcare supports starting next month.

Updated 4.25pm

MINISTER FOR CHILDREN Katherine Zappone has today announced the creation of over 5,000 new childcare places after securing increased funding for the scheme.

The government said hundreds of childcare centres will benefit from the grants aimed at increasing capacity for children of school-going age.

A national awareness campaign has been set up to raise parents’ awareness of the scheme, which has benefitted from €19 million in extra supports.

Zappone said these extra places are part of the “first big step to accessible, affordable childcare” in Ireland, and said she would engage with government colleagues over the next few weeks in an attempt to gain more funding for these projects in the next Budget.

The number of children joining existing government care schemes is six times higher than this time last year, with 3,000 signing up this July compared to 500 in 2016.

Zappone said, “The next focus of our awareness campaign is a call to action telling parents that there are just four weeks to go before extra supports start.

Support will be provided in two ways. A universal support for all children aged six months to three years. That subsidy will be up to €1,040 per year – effectively six weeks of free childcare.

‘A good start’

She added that targeted subsidies for lower-income families would also increase.

“This is a good start,” the minister said, “but much more must be done to turn our childcare system from being one of the most expensive in the world into the best.

We need more funding like this to ensure quality and capacity.

Zappone says she will not be moved down the pecking order during budget negotiations. Says Ireland is way behind childcare provision pic.twitter.com/HMpL0yBGoP — Christina Finn (@christinafinn8) August 1, 2017 Source: Christina Finn /Twitter

At the launch of the campaign, the Taoiseach said he was very pleased to honour the government’s commitment to make childcare more affordable for families.

Lower income families

“For the first time, a universal, non-means tested childcare subsidy will be available for children aged six months to three years. This amounts to a maximum of €1,040 per year, for some the cost of one month of childcare. We will also be providing extra support for parents on lower incomes going back to work or education, providing as much as €145 per week towards the cost of their childcare,” he said, adding:

In a Republic of opportunity everyone should have the chance to access employment and education. Childcare can often be a barrier to this, whereas it should be a bridge to opportunity for parents, their children and our economy.

These new subsidies will create greater parental choice and financial support for families so they can achieve their full potential. I’m delighted that investment made this year will help families begin to feel a difference in their pockets from September.

Middle income earners

Varadkar said he anticipates increased investment in childcare, indicating that extra resources could be dedicated in the next Budget, not only to families with lower incomes, but middle-income earners too.

“Subject to the economy continuing to grow and public finances being in order, I would anticipate that in the years to come we will increase the subsidy and widen the number of people that can benefit from the subsidy,” he said.

Zappone said that budget negotiations are ongoing, but argued that she would be fighting for extra resources for her department.

“I have no intention of going down on the pecking order, just to let you know that,” she jokingly told reporters today.

The Taoiseach said providing subsidies for lower-income families is important as it will allow families to “grow their incomes in the years ahead”.

“I want people to have higher incomes. I want them to move up in terms of living standards and income and that is why the targeted measures in this are very important,” said Varadkar, adding that families will be able to “move from being in lower-income to middle-income in the future”.

"Business group predicts 'exceptional job surge' with 50,000 new roles this year","BUSINESS GROUP IBEC has published its economic outlook from the first three months of this year, and predicts that an additional 50,000 jobs will be created in Ireland in 2017.

The group said that the labour force will grow 2.7% this year and said that this increase, coupled with tax cuts, wage growth and limited inflation “bodes well for consumer spending”.

Another report by accountancy firm EY said that over three-quarters of entrepreneurs plan to recruit more people in the next year, but also highlighted their worries over the ever-increasing cost of doing business in Ireland.

Growth

Ibec forecasts that Ireland’s GDP will grow by 3.1% this year, and by 2.8% in 2018, “driven by a strong domestic economy”.

It said that the country is in a strong position with non-construction employment back to their highest levels since before the economic crisis.

The additional 50,000 jobs will come mostly from the service industry, almost 30,000, with a further increase in industrial sectors but a slight fall expected in the numbers employed in the agriculture sector.

When construction is excluded, most areas of the country are above the pre-crisis peak levels of employment, but the “south-west and particularly the border counties are still some way short”, Ibec said.

While consumer spending is expected to rise 3.3% this year, exports are expected to slow with Brexit effects “already evident” in the sector.

Fergal O’Brien, Ibec’s director of policy and public affairs, said: “The Irish economy is now in a strong position with employment growing by 2.9% in 2016, the fastest rate since 2007.

However, the economic impact of changes to our trading relations with the US and UK are still unknown and are a cause of concern for Irish businesses

Potential changes to the corporate tax rate in the US is a key concern going forward, given the presence of multinationals in Ireland, O’Brien said.

The potential for the US to introduce a border adjustment tax (BAT) is the biggest worry of all which would be “equivalent to imposing tariffs on imports while subsidising exports”.

He added that: “The US hasn’t been this close to a comprehensive corporate tax reform in decades.”

Ibec concluded by urging the government to take advantage of the current economic growth and impose decisive policy action to protect Ireland from the effects of Brexit.

“Investment and liveability issues such as transport, housing and education must be prioritised before the window of exceptionally cheap money closes any further,” O’Brien said.

Costly business

A new survey of entrepreneurs conducted by EY has said that the increasing cost of doing business in Ireland, and attracting the best workers, were among the biggest challenges they faced.

Almost three-quarters (72%) cited the personal tax burden as the biggest inhibiting factor on the appeal of establishing and growing a business here.

A further 62% said the cost of labour was a major inhibiting factor while 61% said the cost of insurance also played a part.

The high tax burden in Ireland also hampers businesses ability to attract the best talent, according to the EY survey.

Kevin McLoughlin, partner lead at EY entrepreneur of the year, said: “At the moment, entrepreneurs suffer a higher tax burden than those in employment, so this is an area that needs to be tackled head-on by government.",https://www.thejournal.ie/jobs-growth-ireland-3320865-Apr2017/,the_journal,1
'She's a curious little thing': Meet the first tropical stingray to be born in Ireland,"THE FIRST TROPICAL stingray to be born in Ireland has been born at National Sea Life in Bray, Co Wicklow.

The Atlantic Cownose Ray is listed as a near threatened species and could face extinction in the future.

As the species matures very late in life, and females only go through one gestation period a year, the new baby has led to great excitement, Sea Life said today.

Source: Patrick Browne

The baby, which was born four weeks ago, has yet to be named, but is a healthy size of 30cm long. She is believed to be a female, but it is still a little early to tell for definite.

Pat Ó Súilleabháin, managing director of Sea Life, said the baby has settled in to her new home well:

She swims around with her Mum, Dad and her uncle and is very happy. She is also a curious little thing, and unusually for a ray so young, shows great interest in visitors, especially children. She comes right up to the edge of the tank to say hello.

The centre waited four weeks to announce the birth of the baby stingray as it wanted to ensure the infant was healthy and thriving.

Sea Life carefully orchestrated this breeding programme, taking in two pairs of male and female Cownose stingrays four years ago. Its stingrays have only just recently reached sexual maturity. Only one of these pairs have bred, but hopes are high that more baby rays will be born in the coming years.",https://www.thejournal.ie/stingray-bray-3341543-Apr2017/,the_journal,1
Grammy winner Chance the Rapper donates $1 million to public schools in Chicago,"CHANCE THE RAPPER’s unusual intervention into Chicago Public Schools’ funding crisis took a more curious turn yesterday when the Grammy-winner presented a $1 million check to city schools.

He then urged Governor Bruce Rauner to use his executive powers to help the nation’s third-largest district.

The Republican governor, a former venture capitalist, responded by noting his own philanthropy and floating Chicago school funding ideas that would face tough odds in the Democratic-controlled legislature.

Illinois has gone two years without a budget, the longest such stalemate of any state in nearly a century.

The back-and-forth came after a meeting Friday between Rauner and the artist — whose real name is Chancelor Bennett — that left the rapper visibly agitated.

Source: Charles Rex Arbogast

Chance asked for the meeting after he won three Grammys last month, including best new artist, and Rauner tweeted congratulations.

The Chicago native stopped at an elementary school near where he grew up to announce the donation to a schools’ foundation, calling himself a “public school kid”. He also accused Rauner of failing to present solutions without “caveats or ultimatums.”

“This isn’t about politics. This isn’t about posturing. This is about taking care of the kids,” he said.

Everybody and their mama knows what’s going on in Chicago. We’re about to enhance the conversation on supporting and funding the education of the kids in Chicago.

At the heart of rapper’s displeasure with Rauner is $215 million in teacher pension relief for Chicago schools that he vetoed last year.

Rauner said a broader pension overhaul was needed, part of his push for pro-business and long-term reforms.

However, the school district of roughly 400,000 students had factored the money into its roughly $5.4 billion budget and had to make mid-year cuts. The district has also proposed ending the school year early to save money.

Rauner, who called the meeting a “good exchange of views,” circulated plans before Chance’s public appearance for ways to recover the $215 million; both require state legislation.

One option calls for using up most of Chicago’s special taxing district funds, set aside for capital projects, for a one-time infusion. The other would attach the funding to broader pension reform.

Chicago officials rejected both, saying Illinois’ school funding formula is fundamentally unfair to the largely minority and poor school district.

CPS (Chicago Public Schools) has sued the state over the calculation and argues the district is further penalised since it’s the only one in Illinois where local taxpayers, not the state, help pay teacher pension costs.

Chance also dismissed the plans, saying he wasn’t a politician.

“It’s not my job to propose any policy or be behind anything but the kids,” he said.

Rauner’s office issued a statement detailing his history of giving: roughly $7 million over 20 years to organisations benefitting Chicago students.

“While the Rauners are passionate donors to our schools, individual contributions will never be enough to address the financial challenges facing CPS,” the statement said.

It would be helpful if CPS officials came to Springfield and joined in serious good faith discussions about the long-term stability of all of our schools.

Rauner has blamed Chicago’s fiscal woes on years of financial mismanagement and argues that Chicago receives hundreds of millions in block grants other schools don’t.

Meanwhile, Chance deemed his donation — from the concert ticket proceeds — a “call to action” and asked other artists and corporations to follow suit.

The rapper has family ties to prominent Democrats. His father worked in former President Barack Obama’s Cabinet and for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

Chance has been civically engaged before, leading a march to the polls in November and serving on the board of Chicago’s DuSable Museum of African-American History.",https://www.thejournal.ie/chance-rapper-donation-3275926-Mar2017/,the_journal,1

Good news for pensioners: The State pension is going up by €5 a week from today,"Updated 6.45pm

TODAY, FINE GAEL published a video on Facebook hailing the pension increase that comes into effect from this week.

The video features a collection of people who will benefit from the increase of €5 a week. The participants frequently mention how much the extra €260 a year will be a great boost.

At one stage, one woman says “God bless Mr Noonan”, referring to Minister for Finance Michael Noonan.

However, the increase to the pension from March, which was announced in last October’s Budget, may have been delayed as it was understood at the time that the increase would be brought in from mid-2017.

The government thinking behind postponing the rise was to allow other possible increases to be given to those on social welfare, such as disabled people, carers, blind people and widows.

Minister Leo Varadkar had already outlined numerous provisions that he said would reform the pensions system in Ireland. In terms of state benefits, the €5 was a commitment paid in the programme for government alongside an increase in other welfare payments.

He said in a statement: “For many of these groups it represents the first increase since 2009. I appreciate that the increase is modest but it is a permanent increase and certainly a step in the right direction.”

Fianna Fáil, however, insisted on its inclusion from January and the matter was a real test for the agreement between that party and Fine Gael on supporting the latter’s Budgets for the next three years.

Although Micheál Martin did not call it a “red line issue”, the increase to the old-age pension was eventually set to be introduced from March.

Fianna Fáil spokesperson for social protection, Limerick TD Willie O’Dea described Fine Gael promoting the pension increase in such a manner as “cynical” and claimed that his party was behind the increase.

#Open journalism No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you Support us now

“It was forced on them by us essentially,” he told TheJournal.ie. “They were under threat that we wouldn’t support the budget, and they gave it grudgingly.”

He said that any increases to state benefits would normally take effect from 1 January but, because this did not come into effect until March, the benefit to people over the course of a year would be less than €5 a week.

It was something they may as well have been forced at gunpoint do. [Using a video] is cynical, and people will see it as that. There’s a lot of cynicism about politics out there, and this just creates more of it. Its contemptible really.

O’Dea added that the increase was a bare minimum that was required for pensioners, and said that no increases were made to the pension for the majority of Fine Gael’s time in government since 2011.

Anyone over the age of 66 in receipt of a pension, including older carers and widows, will receive an increase.

Fine Gael said the increase will directly affect 600,000 people across the country.",https://www.thejournal.ie/fine-gael-pension-3279385-Mar2017/,the_journal,1

WATCH: This is the song that will represent us at the Eurovision,"IRELAND’S ENTRY INTO this year’s Eurovision has been released.

RTÉ has announced that Brendan Murray will perform the ballad Dying To Try at the song contest in Kiev in Ukraine this May.

The ballad was co-written by Swedish Grammy-nominated songwriter Jörgen Elofsson and British songwriter James Newman. The song was chosen from over 320 entries by a judging panel of six industry professionals. Elofsson has written hits for Britney Spears, Celine Dion and Westlife.

Murray, from Tuam in Co Galway, is a member of Louis Walsh’s boyband Hometown. He said he’s “very proud and honoured” to be representing Ireland at the Eurovision.

Source: YouTube

“When I first heard Dying To Try I instantly fell in love with it and knew it was the perfect song for me. I couldn’t wait to get into the studio to record it. My mam teared up the first time she heard it so that was a good start,” he said.

Walsh said Dying To Try “really stood out from the other songs that were entered by songwriters from all over the world”.

I chose Brendan Murray because he is an amazing singer and his voice is so unique, I’ve never heard anyone like him before. The song and the singer are modern and contemporary and it’s a perfect combination for this years Eurovision in Kiev. Ireland hasn’t won Eurovision since 1996, which is the same year that Brendan was born so perhaps that’s a lucky omen.

As is a Eurovision tradition here, Brendan will perform the song on the Late Late Show in late April.",https://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-eurovision-entry-2017-3281436-Mar2017/,the_journal,1
Going on holiday? Roaming charges are abolished from today,"GOOD NEWS FOR holidaymakers travelling around the EU: roaming charges are being abolished as of today.

From today onwards, the extra charges for sending texts or making phone calls while abroad in an EU country will be no more. There will also be a heftier data allowance for users before extra charges kick in.

Today marks the culmination of a decade of effort by EU lawmakers to eliminate the charges across EU countries.

Officials sought to get rid of the high bills and costs that faced travellers using their mobile phones while abroad.

“Eliminating roaming charges is one of the greatest and most tangible successes of the EU,” EU leaders said in a joint statement.

“Over the last 10 years, our institutions have been working hard together to fix this market failure.

We are proud that the EU has put an end to very high roaming prices and thankful to those who showed the determination to overcome the many challenges and pursue this goal.

So what does this actually mean?

Basically, as of today making phone calls and sending texts while in Europe will cost the same as it does when you’re at home.

So if you have free calls and texts to every network here, you will be able to use those while abroad at no additional cost.

With data allowances it’s not quite as clear-cut, however.

Data restrictions were agreed between the European Commission and mobile networks to help phone networks because of the wholesale charges operators charge each other for network access.

Data allowances can be restricted to as little as 3GB per month under the EU rules and customers can be charged up to €9.50 per gigabyte in fees beyond their allowance.

In cases where an operator is providing an all you can eat service, the company can limit data volumes to twice what the customer would be able to buy with the value of their contract.

Anyone who is on a €20 a month bill can be capped at 4.2GB of roaming data per month, even if that plan gives unlimited data at home.

However, if you’re on a two-year contract where you get your phone for free as part of it, the mobile operator can deduct the phone cost from the calculation. If you’re paying €60 a month and have an iPhone 7 – that could eat up half of your allocation.

And once customers go over their allowance, they’ll be hit with the roaming charges of around €9.50 per GB.

Each network operator has different ways in which they will be delivering the data allowance, so it is worth checking with your own before you travel.

Updated at 9pm

AROUND 248,000 HOMES and businesses have had their power restored, while 169,000 still remain without power in the aftermath of the deadly Storm Ophelia.

So far, 65% of premises that lost power during the extreme weather have had it restored.

ESB Networks has said that the majority of customers will have their power restored in three to four days, but that ”serious damage” remained in the south and southwest.

It added that it was “hopeful” that northwest and Dublin households and businesses would have power restored in full by this evening.

We are also making significant progress in counties Kerry, Laois, Galway, Clare and Westmeath. Cork and Kerry have had power restored to over 100,000 customers.

The power outages are spread all over the country, with the south and south-west particularly badly hit. At the height of the storm 385,000 customers were without power, making it a more damaging storm than 2014′s Storm Darwin.

In a statement, ESB Networks said that its repair crews will be assisted by contractors and crews from other electricity utilities who will travel from Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland this evening to help.

“All available resources from ESB Networks are being deployed to carry out repairs to the network and restore power,” the statement said.

Fallen trees on overhead lines were responsible for most of the damage to the network.

In many cases, crews are having difficulty gaining access to power lines as they are hampered by fallen trees and debris.

ESB Networks said that the crews are prioritising repairs to higher voltage lines. “Restoring power to essential services such as water pumping and sewage facilities, medical facilities and customers with medical needs are a priority,” the statement said.

“We are advising all customers impacted by outages that they should prepare to be without electricity for a number of days. ESB Networks are particularly concerned about customers who use electrically powered medical devices and who are without power. It is important that these customers contact their healthcare professional so that they can receive advice on their care during this period.”

The company is telling members of the public to not touch fallen power lines and to report those to 1850 372 999.

Customers can check PowerCheck for updates.

Separately, Eir says that it estimates around 30,000 customers are without broadband, telephone and mobile services as result of Storm Ophelia.

While damage has been sustained throughout the country, the southwest and midlands are the worst affected areas and in particular Cork County.

Some large-scale faults in Kinsale, Co Cork and Tralee, Co Kerry have already been restored.

Both Sky Ireland and Virgin Media are advising customers of disruption. A statement by Virgin says:

“Safety is our top priority so it may be possible that some of you in may be still be without service.

“We will endeavour to restore your service as quickly as possible but only when it’s safe to do so.”

Baby girl born with heart outside her chest survives three surgeries,"Source: Leicester Hospitals

Warning: This article contains graphic imagery of an infant.

A BABY IN the UK has survived three surgeries after being born with her heart outside of her chest, in what is believed to be a UK first.

Baby Vanellope was diagnosed with Ectopia cordis, a rare condition that means the baby is born with a hole in her chest and her heart is outside of her body.

Vanellope was due to be delivered on Christmas Eve, but was born prematurely by caesarean section on 22 November because of the condition.

The three-week-old baby has undergone three surgeries at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester and survived, which the hospital believes is the first UK baby to do so.

Source: Leicester Hospitals/Twitter

According to the BBC, the baby’s parents were informed of the condition 16 weeks into the pregnancy, and were advised to terminate it.

The baby’s parents told the BBC of how they reacted as they waited for news of whether their baby’s surgery was successful.

“We were just staring at each other because we didn’t want to be told what was happening while it was happening,” the baby’s dad Dean said.

But as soon as we heard her cry, that was it. We just had a little cry.

“It’s like we held our breath through it all for her,” her mother said.

Vanellope will have to go through further surgery at a later stage.

The hospital’s paediatric cardiologist Frances Bu’Lock said that Vanellope was “lucky” in a way, because she had a “structurally normal heart which most of these babies don’t have”.

She didn’t have any other abnormalities with chromosomes. Sometimes the bowel is outside the body as well, she’s not had any of those problems.

“But she’s also proved very resilient and she’s had a great team to support her.”

Her parents explained that she was named after a character in the animated film Wreck-It Ralph who was a “glitch”. They said the name fit perfectly because their daughter’s condition was like a glitch “it wasn’t real and it could be fixed”.",https://www.thejournal.ie/baby-heart-out-of-chest-leicester-3748191-Dec2017/,the_journal,1

Boost for Cork City as Delaney extends his stay with league leaders,"CORK CITY HAVE received a timely boost with news that Ryan Delaney’s loan deal has been extended.

The 20-year-old defender joined on a six-month contract back in January but, after talks with parent club Burton Albion, he will now remain with the Leesiders until the end of the 2017 campaign.

Named SSE Airtricity League/SWAI Player of the Month for May just this week, the Wexford native has been excellent at the back for John Caulfield’s unbeaten side, who hold an 18-point lead at the top of the table after conceding just nine goals so far.

With captain John Dunleavy expected to miss the rest of the season through injury and Kevin O’Connor expected to join Sean Maguire at Preston North End, keeping Delaney looks a great bit of business.

“We are delighted to have extended Ryan’s loan until the end of the season,” said Caulfield.

“He came in under the radar before the start of the season and he settled in very quickly, having an immediate impact. He has gone from strength to strength and has become a vital cog in our team, as we can see from the clean sheets we have kept.”

“As well as being a key part of our back five, he has also scored important goals for us and everyone can see that he is developing into a tremendous player.

“To keep him to the end of the season, with our position in the league and Europe coming up, is fantastic news for us. Also, with the disappointing news about Johnny Dunleavy’s injury in mind, it was very important for us to keep Ryan and I am very pleased that we have agreed this deal.”

I would like to thank Burton Albion, and Nigel Clough in particular, who have been fantastic to deal with, and I hope it is a relationship that we can build on, because Burton are a really good club to deal with.

“The fact that Ryan came to the club as a player unknown to many people and has just won the Soccer Writer’s Player of the Month award shows how well he has done, and we expect him to kick on now in the second half of the season and have an even bigger impact.”

Free 'Baby Box' to be given to all new mothers in Wexford Hospital,"WEXFORD HOSPITAL IS set to become only the second hospital in Ireland to offer an initiative that is designed to give all babies an equal start in life.

The “Baby Box” initiative is launching today, which will see thousands of newborns benefit from access to the box that acts as a bed, and provides a range of supplies to support the parents of newborns from clothes and nappies to bedding and small toys.

The initiative started in the 1930s in Finland, where expectant mothers are given a box, or “starter kit”, full of clothes, sheets and toys.

Stacked inside each box is a range of essentials, including bodysuits, a sleeping bag, outdoor gear, bathing products, nappies and bedding. This provision is available for all expectant mothers in the country.

The initiative in Wexford Hospital will follow a similar pattern.

Although it may have been in place in the Scandinavian country for quite some time, other countries are now beginning to trial their own version of the Baby Box, including Ireland.

Last year, the first pilot of the Baby Box scheme in Ireland was rolled out in University Maternity Hospital Limerick.

When the Limerick version was launched, Dr Mendinaro Imcha, Consultant Gynaecologist/Obstetrician, UMHL, said the programme “is a proactive approach to improving the health and safety of the newborn child and parents”.

“We are combining tradition with current technology and supporting the newborn child’s family with online educational material covering a broad range of essential topics on ante and postnatal care,” he added.

The Scottish government also recently announced that every newborn in the country would be given a box of essential items, “based on the Finnish model”.

Infant mortality

The boxes may have a more practical application than simply providing a lot of essentials for newborn babies, as the practice of offering what amounts to a cot has been identified as a contributory factor in Finland’s low infant mortality rate.

According to figures from the World Bank, for every 1,000 babies born in Finland, two children die before the age of five. It has the lowest infant mortality rate in the EU.

In contrast, just under four babies per 1,000 die before the age of five in Ireland.

When the Baby Boxes were introduced, nearly 90 babies per 1,000 children died before the age of 5.

This initiative, along with the introduction of a national health insurance system and a centralised hospital network in the 1960s, is credited with contributing to this sharp fall in infant mortality rates.

The actual box itself, when used as a cot for the baby, can be slept in for the first six months. It is believed that the small size of the box prevents babies from rolling onto their bellies, which experts think can contribute to sudden infant death syndrome (Sids), or cot death.

Mothers at Wexford hospital will also be given access to the Baby Box University, an online learning portal that teaches parents all about breastfeeding, paediatric first aid, nutrition and maternal mental health.

This resource uses online video tutorials, and is available in 17 different languages.

When launching the Scottish version, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It’s a simple idea with a proven record in tackling deprivation, improving health and supporting parents, and I’m proud and excited that the pilot is now underway”.

HIV treatment tablets which are given for free to patients in the Philippines.

THE NUMBER OF AIDS-related deaths have been halved in the past 12 years, and more people than ever are receiving treatment for HIV, in a shift that’s seen as a victory against the stigmatised virus for which there’s no known cure.

AIDS claimed a million lives in 2016 – almost half the 2005 toll that marked the peak of the deadly epidemic.

The information was published in a United Nations report today, ahead of an AIDS science conference opening in Paris this Sunday.

“AIDS-related deaths have fallen from 1.9 million in 2005 to one million in 2016,” said the authors, adding that “for the first time the scales have tipped”.

“In 2016, 19.5 million of the 36.7 million people living with HIV had access to treatment,” said the UNAIDS global roundup. That data marks the first time that more than half of infected people were receiving anti-retroviral treatment, which subdues the AIDS virus but does not kill it.

The year 2016 saw 1.8 million new infections, almost half the record number of some 3.5 million in 1997, said the report.

In total, 76.1 million people have been infected with HIV – the virus that causes AIDS – since the epidemic started in the 1980s. Some 35 million have died.

“Communities and families are thriving as AIDS is being pushed back,” said UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe.

As we bring the epidemic under control, health outcomes are improving and nations are becoming stronger.

As yet, there is no HIV vaccine or cure, and infected people rely on lifelong anti-retroviral therapy to stop the virus replicating.

Without treatment, HIV-infected people go on to develop AIDS, a syndrome that weakens the immune system and leaves the body exposed to opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, and some types of cancer.

Treatment carries side effects and is costly, but allows infected people to be healthier for longer.

‘More work to do’

Most progress has been made in east and southern Africa, the region that was hardest hit by the epidemic and where many interventions were focused.

Since 2010, AIDS-related deaths in the region declined by 42%. The region accounts for half the world’s infected population, with women and girls disproportionately affected at 60%.

Sixty percent of all people who receive anti-retroviral therapy live in east and southern Africa which, along with west and central Europe and the Americas, is on target to meet the so-called 90-90-90 targets set by the UN, said the report.

By 2020, states the plan, 90% of infected people must know their status, of whom 90% must be on treatment. In 90% of those, the virus will be “suppressed” by medicine to the extent that it cannot function or replicate.

By 2016, 70% of infected people knew their status, said the new report. Of those, 77% were on treatment, and 82% had virus suppression.

UNAIDS expressed concern about two regions with worsening AIDS trends: the Middle East-North Africa, and eastern Europe-central Asia. Both are areas marred by conflict and political uncertainty.

New HIV infections rose by 60% in eastern Europe and central Asia, and deaths by almost a third from 2010 to 2016.

In the Middle East and North Africa, the number of AIDS deaths increased by a fifth in the last six years.

“Globally, progress has been significant, but there is still more work to do,” the authors said in a statement.

“Around 30% of people living with HIV still do not know their HIV status, 17.1 million people living with HIV do not have access to anti-retroviral therapy, and more than half of all people living with HIV are not virally suppressed.”

Of the total infected population, over two million were children younger than 15, said UNAIDS. Only 43% of them were on treatment.

New infections among children almost halved from 300,000 in 2010 to 160,000 last year, said the report.

This was partly due to more and more HIV-infected pregnant women – 76% in 2016 – having access to drugs blocking virus transmission to their offspring.

350 new jobs announced for Cork and Dublin,"SOME 350 NEW jobs have been announced for Dublin and Cork this morning.

The global headquarters of technology company eShop is being officially opened in Swords today as the company announces plans to hire 250 new staff over the next three years.

Meanwhile, Kings Laundry has announced 100 new jobs at its Cork facility. There are also 80 seasonal positions available in Cork and Dublin for the coming summer.

The new permanent positions bring the total workforce at Kings Laundry to over 550.

eShop

eShop was launched in Dublin in 2010 with six staff. It currently employs 150 staff mainly in Swords but also in Newry, the US, Singapore and the Netherlands.

A spokesperson told TheJournal.ie that the “vast majority” of the 250 new jobs announced today will be based in Swords with a small number abroad.

They estimated that 200 of the jobs will be based at its global headquarters at Airside Business Park in Swords.

Today’s jobs announcement for eShop is part of a €25m investment for the eCommerce and logistics management company.

eShopWorld says it has already started recruiting to fill these full-time, highly skilled roles, which are focused on technical development and R&D activity.

eShopWorld CEO Tommy Kelly said, “We are very pleased to be adding jobs and investment to fulfil demand from leading global brands.”

Minister for Education and Skills, Richard Bruton, said:

Here is an innovative Irish company, established 6 years ago, which now employs 150 people and has a turnover of over €200 million.

“Today’s announcement that eShopWorld are creating 250 jobs in Ireland is a great boost and a huge indication of what’s possible.”

Kings Laundry

Kings Laundry also announced it’s investing a further €2m in its new state-of-the-art facility in Little Island in Cork.

Alan Murphy, Sales Director at Kings Laundry said, “2016 was a very successful year, we saw an increase of 18% in our turnover and we’re expecting this to increase further by over 20% this year.

“This is down to winning significant new business across the country as well as driving efficiencies within our service offering.

“We operate the most modern and energy efficient facilities in Europe and have the capability of servicing 1.5m pieces of laundry per week in Cork, allowing further room to grow.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-technology-company-250-jobs-3296550-Mar2017/,the_journal,1
plan to abolish retirement age welcomed,"A SINN FÉIN bill debated this week would abolish the mandatory retirement age.

The bill, the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2016 is being brought forward by deputies John Brady and Denise Mitchell and was debated on Thursday night in the Dáil.

It has received widespread welcome from older people’s groups.

Age Action pointed out that similar legislation proposed by former TD Anne Ferris received cross-party backing in 2015 and urged all parties to support older workers.

Justin Moran, Head of Advocacy and Communications at Age Action, said: “Mandatory retirement is simply age discrimination, forcing someone out of a job because they’ve reached some arbitrary age set by their employer.

“People retiring today are expected, on average, to live 20 years or more. The number of people aged over 65 is going to almost treble in the next thirty years.

“If someone wants to work and can do the job, why should they be forced out because they turn 65?”

A briefing paper published by Age Action late last year explains EU employment law forbids discrimination on the basis of age but a loophole allows Member States to treat workers differently if justified by a ‘legitimate aim’.

Peter Kavanagh of Active Retirement called the loophole “glaring”.

Retirement should be all about choice, and no employer should have the right to tell a worker they are less able to do their job because they have reached a certain birthday. Some people want to retire at 65, or earlier, and that’s really positive. They should be supported to do so. For those who feel able to stay on in work and who want to for financial or social reasons, they should equally be supported to stay in the work force at least until pensionable age, if not beyond.

Brady said the bill “seeks to put an end to this discrimination and give workers choice when it comes to their retirement” and says it will address a major pensions issue.

“This bill will also address two major pension issues. It will end the current practice of those forced to sign on for jobseekers payments at 65 for one year until they are eligible for the State Pension at 66. It will give people who have insufficient contributions for the State Pension an opportunity to continue at work to make up the additional contributions to avoid a reduced pension if they so wish.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/retirement-age-4-3254775-Feb2017/,the_journal,1
Tech and media companies have announced 153 new jobs for Dublin,"THERE WAS GOOD news on the jobs front today in Dublin, with 153 new jobs announced across four technology companies from North America and Europe.

Of these, 65 of these jobs are coming to Canadian media company Pressreader. They’re going to be recruiting for roles in research and development, multi-lingual business development, sales and marketing and management and administration.

Its CEO Alex Kroogman said the company had decided to open a Dublin office because “Ireland is at the epicentre of innovation in Europe.”

Another 50 jobs will be created by Looker, who are opening its first European headquarters in Dublin.

Using platforms to help businesses get to grips with data, they will be hiring for roles in sales, marketing and professional services and support over the next three years.

Workflow automation software provider ThinkSmart will create 20 jobs in sales and customer support roles when it opens its Dublin office.

ArtofUs, who specialise in the Internet of Things market, will be bringing 18 research and development jobs to Dublin.

"'Thanks to books, I feel free': The man with the most degrees in history","THE WORLD RECORD holder for the most university degrees is a cheery but truculent 70-year old Italian.

Luciano Baietti lives in the town of Velletri in the Alban Hills near Rome and spends his days pottering around his small house and garden.

Early every morning at 3am he pulls out his textbooks and starts studying.

He now holds 15 bachelors or masters degrees from universities across Italy, and is already embarking on his 16th.

“Thanks to books, I feel free, dammit,” he told international news agency AFP.

“After all, the words share the same root,” he says, referring to the Italian words libro (book) and libero (free).

The certificates proving his prowess hang on the walls of his study, framing a portrait of the 19th century French essayist, Louis-Francois Bertin, whom he cites as an influence.

Passion for a challenge

“He was a man of culture and knowledge,” said Baietti, a former headmaster of a secondary school, who made it into the Guinness Book of Records in 2002 with his eighth degree, that time in motor skills.

At that point he already had degrees in sociology, literature, law, political science and philosophy, most from Rome’s prestigious La Sapienza University, one of the oldest in the world.

Since then he’s added seven others to his list, including one in criminology, a distance-learning one in military strategies from Turin, and the latest in tourism from an online university in Naples, which he was awarded at the start of this month.

“Each time I set myself a new challenge, to see how far my body and my brain can go,” says Baietti, who started life as a sports teacher.

His long-suffering wife, some 30 years his junior, describes Baietti affectionately as “a real character” who is known throughout their town.

He got most of the qualifications under his belt while also doing his day job and volunteering with Italy’s Red Cross.

This ageing eternal student’s first degree was in physical education in 1972 – and he fell instantly in love with the academic world.

As well as the sporting events, there were modules in theory which I liked, and which gave me a taste for studying.

‘I surprised myself’

The most challenging and unusual degree so far has been the military strategies one: “It was co-organised by the defence ministry and Turin University and dealt with sensitive subjects related to national security”.

“We had to attend the exams in uniform,” he recalls, showing off the regimental garb hanging in his wardrobe.

His masters in criminology, which saw him interview prisoners, also had a lasting impact.

Listening to them, I sometimes surprised myself; I’d be convinced by their arguments, and would wonder about what was right or wrong – before realising that I had gone off course.

Baietti is back on course, and already preparing to start the next degree, this time in food science.

Once again, he’ll be pouring over his books by the light of his desk lamp as outside the world sleeps on.

“At that time the brain is more open to assimilating knowledge, and it also allows me to keep a normal family life,” he says with a grin.

Ireland's first sneaker label launches this week,"AN IRISH BUSINESSMAN will this week launch the country’s first shoe label.

King Of Soles will make its creations available for pre-order from tomorrow, with just 300 pairs of each launch design being made.

The company’s founder Glenn Heaslip says the product is premium leather and cheaper than big brands.

Heaslip got his start selling…basically everything he could.

“I got to this point by buying all sorts wholesale and selling it, from robot hoovers to vaporisers, clothes etc, at carboot sales, eBay, local classified sites.

“I was selling a lot on eBay, different sites, and people would often tell me they loved their product & thank me. I’d think why are you thanking me? I didn’t make this, I bought it at one price & sold it at another, nothing more. I take no credit.

“If people didn’t buy a vaporiser or jersey from me, they’d buy it elsewhere, nobody remembers the eBay seller, nobody notices, you’re one of many selling the same thing, if your seller account disappeared it’d never be noted. So a desire to make something, that people loved and enjoyed was born.”

To that end, Heaslip created King of Soles with the plan of making something that will last.

I was inspired by spray painted custom shoes. I’d seen these selling at €300 a pair, as amazing as they were, the paint will inevitably one day crack and the integrity of the design be ruined. I wanted the design to last, and thought people should be getting these shoes much cheaper, much better quality, the design patterns should be printed into a leather fabric, not sprayed onto it.

“This was something bubbling and festering in my mind for years. It was reignited when I read a piece on the businesses with the highest mark ups, I just thought the shoe industry was obscene in terms of how much they overcharge customers. My favourite shoes that I’ve ever seen, they’ve been in windows – I’ve definitely not owned them.

Also around that time, early 2014, I read a piece about planned obsolescence. Very few people can say they’ve bought a nice looking pair of shoes at an affordable price & they’ve lasted years. King Of Soles will provide shoe quality that’ll allow you to stay out of the shoe stores for a long time.

“Unlike brands that mass-manufacture low quality products in wasteful factories, King Of Soles believes everyone should have access to beautiful, affordable shoes that last a lifetime.”

Man rescued after being found clinging to his kayak off Cork coast today,"A MAN WAS rescued today after he was found by the Youghal RNLI clinging to his kayak off Redbarn beach in Cork.

His kayak had been tipped over and he was said to have been in serious difficulty.

The RNLI said they had no doubt that a “life was saved”.

A member of the Youghal coast guard had been driving by the beach and saw what looked like someone in difficulty in the water. Another member of the public also raised the alarm.

The RNLI received the call, and a volunteer crew was dispatched at 2pm today.

The lifeboat crew saw the kayaker clinging to the board that he’d fallen from. He was unable to get back into the kayak, and had been in the cold sea for almost 45 minutes before the crew made it to him and rescued him.

The man was showing signs of hypothermia and was attended to by a doctor from the East Cork Rapid Response. He has since been transferred to Cork University Hospital.

The RNLI said that the fact he was wearing a lifejacket was vital.

Derry Walsh, Youghal RNLI Lifeboat Operations Manager said: “The kayaker who was wearing a lifejacket when he got into difficulty this afternoon, had been in the water for a long time before he was spotted and he was suffering from hypothermia when we reached him.

Time was of the essence and I have no doubt that a life was saved.

“Our crew responded rapidly and used their skills and training to administer casualty care. The kayaker was lucky today and all at Youghal RNLI would like to wish him a speedy recovery following his ordeal.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/rnli-rescue-mission-3248190-Feb2017/,the_journal,1
Prescriptions are going to be cheaper for over-70s with a medical card from tomorrow,"MINISTER FOR HEALTH Simon Harris has announced that medical card holders over 70 years of age, including their dependents, will have to pay less for their prescriptions from tomorrow.

From Wednesday 1 March, the cost for a prescription will be reduced from €2.50 to €2 per item. The maximum monthly limit will also be reduced from €25 to €20.

The department said in a statement that over 390,000 medical card holders would benefit from the new reductions.

Harris said: “Naturally as we grow older, we require more medical help and assistance and from tomorrow, 390,000 of our older friends and family will pay less for their medicines.”

The Minister added that implementing a reduced cost for over-70s was a key part of the Programme for Government.

The Irish Pharmacy Union, however, said that this reduction was only “the first step” in necessary reforms to the cost of prescriptions.

In the long term, it would rather see no charge placed on prescriptions for medical card holders over the age of 70.

Its President Daragh Connolly said: “We would hope that this is only a first step at phasing out the levy, which has put economic barriers in the way of patients taking their medicines.

At the very least, we would call on the Minister to review the application of the levy and not apply it to vulnerable patients, such as those in residential care settings, homeless patients, patients with intellectual disabilities and palliative care patients.

Connolly added that putting a cost to prescriptions for medical card holders risks the health of those who can’t afford to pay for these medicines.

The Irish Pharmacy Union advises all medical card holders aged 70 and over to make themselves known to pharmacy staff so they can benefit from this reduction from tomorrow.

The HSE also welcomed the measure, asking people to remind their pharmacist if they are eligible.",https://www.thejournal.ie/prescriptions-medical-card-3263939-Feb2017/,the_journal,1
260-year-old map shows plans for avenue to Dublin Castle,"THE OLDEST OF Dublin city’s archived photos and materials include a map from 1757 planning to build an avenue to Dublin Castle.

Dublin City Council published an online archive this week of images of Ireland from the past 100 years, as well as photographs of memorabilia that they have in their possession.

Among the oldest pieces in their possession are 260-year-old maps proposing changes to the city centre.

The plans (shown in the grey bits of road on the map below) were to open a principal avenue to Dublin Castle.

This would be the beginning of a new avenue named Parliament Street.

Plans started in 1757

Source: Dublin City Library and Archive

The polemic map where the plans originate (above) is attributed to George Semple, who was the architect of Essex Bridge, which is now called Grattan Bridge.

This map was distributed to members of House of Commons and Dublin City Assembly, and led directly to an Act of Parliament in 1758 to establish the Wide Street Commissioners.

In the panel on the left-hand side of the map, it lists the problems Semple felt need fixing:

That the Royal Palace or Castle is of a very difficult access and most totally concealed by means of the old Cork House on Cork Hill.

That the passage from the Castle from Essek Bridhe (a very great thoroughfare) is extremely crooked and narrow, not being more than 18 feet broad, at the end of Copper-Alley on the Blind Quay.

That at the North End of Ormond [Quay], the passage for the public is not more than 21 feet in breadth, but at the Head of King’s Inn Quay and about the North End of the Old Bridge (a very dangerous and great thoroughfare) it is only about 15 or 18 feet broad.

‘A handsome colonnade’

Based on the list of problems above, they list these three solutions, two of which are:

To open and make a small square before the Castle extending from the left side of Salutation Alley to the west side of Cork Hill.

To open a new street on the west side of the said little square. Fifty-one feet wide, in a direct line over Essex Bridge to Capel Street, which said direct line will extend above half an English mile in length, northerly and the South End of the direct line or avenue, will be terminated by Bermingham Tower and another gate which maybe built on that canace piece of ground between the buildings of the upper castle yard and the Treasury Office, answerable to the present gate of said upper yard, with a handsome colonnade or a plazza betwixt said two gates, for the guards.

The building of the avenue which was completed between 1758-1762 was mainly in accordance with the 1757 plan, though a different architect was responsible.",https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-city-old-map-3254917-Feb2017/,the_journal,1

Mahershala Ali's Oscar win last night was a truly historic one,"HEAVILY-BACKED FAVOURITE Mahershala Ali won the best supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of a drug dealer in coming-of-age drama Moonlight — becoming the first Muslim film star to pick up a golden statuette.

A first-time nominee, the 43-year-old actor saw off competition from Britain’s Dev Patel, veteran US actors Jeff Bridges and Michael Shannon and newcomer Lucas Hedges.

“I want to thank my teachers, my professors,” Ali said.

“One thing that they consistently told me… ‘It’s not about you. It’s about these characters. You are a servant. You’re in service to these stories and these characters’.”

He thanked his fellow cast members — and his wife, who gave birth to their first child, a girl, just days earlier.

Barry Jenkins’s Moonlight tells the life story of a young African-American struggling to find his place as he grows up in a rough neighborhood of Miami.

In a brief but acclaimed performance, Ali’s drug dealer Juan imparts life lessons to the protagonist Chiron that help him survive in prison and in the outside world.

The role won Oakland-born Ali best supporting actor at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, although he lost out to Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Nocturnal Animals) at the Golden Globes.

‘It’s not new’

Ali, a Muslim convert since 1999 with a Christian minister for a mother, joined the minority Ahmadiyya Community, a movement seen as heretical by other Islamic sects, in 2001.

Muslims have won Oscars in various categories over the years — including Pakistani documentary filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and feature director Asghar Farhadi — but none has taken a statuette for acting.

Ellen Burstyn, who won a best actress Oscar in 1975, has practiced a blend of Sufism and other religions since her late 30s but has said she considers herself a “spirit open to the truth” rather than a Muslim.

“Regardless of one’s theology or how you see life or relate to worshipping God, as an artist your job is the same… to try and tell the truth,” he said backstage on Sunday.

He added that he didn’t feel an actor’s religion was relevant to his work unless it “gives you more empathy to the people you have to advocate for.”

Ali recently told Britain’s Radio Times magazine that he discovered he was on an FBI watchlist after the 11 September, 2001 attacks.

“If you convert to Islam after a couple of decades of being a black man in the US, the discrimination you receive as a Muslim doesn’t feel like a shock,” he said.

I’ve been pulled over, asked where my gun is, asked if I’m a pimp, had my car pulled apart. Muslims will feel like there’s this new discrimination that they hadn’t received before — but it’s not new for us.

Before Moonlight, Ali is best known however for his Emmy-nominated portrayal of White House lobbyist turned chief of staff Remy Danton in Netflix political drama House of Cards.

iTunes visionary praises Irish pledge to give all children access to arts and coding,"“ONE OF THE most inspiring initiatives” in the world – the newly-launched project to give Irish creativity a place at the table of public policy has been given a warm welcome by one of the giants of the tech world.

Denzyl Feigelson, who was key to the setting up of iTunes and remains a key advisor to Apple, is one of several high-profile arts, tech and culture figures who are getting behind the Creative Ireland project which was launched last month.

Among the initiatives announced at that launch were the setting up of local culture teams that would take charge of planning and executing a plan for cultural events and projects in their area, a new annual cultural day for Easter Monday (taking the lead from last year’s successful Reflecting the Rising event), investment programmes for capital projects, support for artists from filmmakers to authors to musicians and an eye-catching pledge to support free tuition for all children in music, drama, art or coding.

The latter is proving particularly popular in getting the message across to an international audience that Ireland is now putting its artistic identity on an official footing.

The most recent launch of the project was at the Irish Embassy in London where – in the wake of Brexit – the need to underline Ireland’s unique contributions to the EU and the world struck a particularly timely note:

Galway mathematicians have found a way of making Batman's cape,"Great news for fans of the Caped Crusader: his gadgets are coming to life.

Great news for fans of the Caped Crusader: his gadgets are coming to life.

RESEARCHERS AT NUI Galway have discovered a formula that will allow them to make Batman’s cape a reality.

Applied mathematicians from NUI Galway published a formula on Friday that works out how much voltage soft conductive materials or ‘dielectric’ membranes can take before they break.

Dielectric membranes are lightweight soft materials that can deploy (or expand) and stiffen when put under high voltage, but until now, there has been a big challenge in knowing what the breaking point of these membranes is.

Professor Michel Destrade, at the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Applied Mathematics in NUI Galway explains how it works:

If you can remember the scene in Batman Begins where this huge bat cape emerges from a tiny folded piece of material, that’s the kind of technology which is being developed currently in some labs around the world, especially in Harvard University and in China.

“It’s the electric voltage that allows these special membranes to expand. Until now it was not fully understood how much voltage these membranes could sustain.

“Some are a millimetre thick, but if they thin out too much when they stretch with the voltage, it can lead to a short-circuit and a catastrophic breakdown. We hope our mathematical formula will help advance science in this area.”

Dr Giuseppe Zurlo of NUI Galway, co-author of the study, adds: “The very near and real applications for these materials are artificial human muscles, or soft robots which can help organs function.”

Together with collaborators at Politecnico di Bari in Italy, the mathematicians worked out a simple formula to link the physical properties of the membrane to the breakdown amount of stretch.

“The final equation is very compact,” says Dr Zurlo. “And it will provide most useful safety guidelines for future experiments on these fascinating materials.”

The problem had stumped material scientists for years. Now the solution, published in the Physical Review Letters, could pave the way for ‘smart’ clothes, or making clothes with electronic capabilities.",https://www.thejournal.ie/researchers-batman-cape-3245365-Feb2017/,the_journal,1
There's a bid to let Swedish workers go home and have sex on their break,"Man behind it sees ""no reason"" why the motion wouldn't pass.

Man behind it sees ""no reason"" why the motion wouldn't pass.

SWEDES SHOULD TAKE a one-hour paid break from work to go home and have sex with their partners, a local councillor suggested.

The proposal from Per-Erik Muskos is aimed at improving people’s personal relationships.

“There are studies that show sex is healthy,” Muskos, a 42-year-old city councillor for the northern town of Overtornea, told AFP after presenting the motion.

He said couples were not spending enough time with each other in today’s society.

“It’s about having better relationships,” he said.

He noted there was no way to verify that employees do not use their hour for other purposes than spending time with their partners or spouses.

“You can’t guarantee that a worker doesn’t go out for a walk instead,” Muskos said, adding that employers needed to trust their employees.

Muskos said he “saw no reason” why the motion wouldn’t pass.

After the Finns and the French, Swedish full-time employees worked the least in Europe with only 1,685 hours on average in 2015, according to a study by economic research institute Coe-Rexecode.

Irish full-time employees worked an average of 1,809 hours compared to 1,874 for Brits and 1,845 for Germans.

Disney airs its first same-sex kiss,"DISNEY HAS AIRED its very first same-sex kiss, in a recent episode of one its animated TV shows.

The show, called Star vs the Forces of Evil, features two of the protagonists attending a concert and shows loved-up couples kissing during one of the songs.

The show, aired on Disney XD and now in its second season, is not the first to feature a same-sex couple, but it is the first time that a couple has been shown kissing.

Live-action Disney Channel show Good Luck Charlie featured a story arc involving a lesbian couple, while Gravity Falls featured two gay policemen.

Furthermore, this won’t be Disney’s only airing of same-sex relations this year.

The upcoming live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast is set to feature a subplot where Le Fou, the sidekick of the evil antagonist Gaston, is confused by his sexuality and attracted to the villain.

Director Bill Condon said: “Le Fou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston… It’s somebody who’s just realising that he has these feelings. And Josh [actor Josh Gad] makes something really subtle and delicious out of it.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/disney-same-sex-kiss-3265728-Mar2017/,the_journal,1
David Bowie's son paid an emotional tribute as his iconic father cleaned up at the Brit Awards,"DAVID BOWIE POSTHUMOUSLY won two Brit awards in an emotional London ceremony which also saw tributes paid to the late George Michael.

Superstar Bowie won both the categories he was nominated for, picking up awards for British male solo artist and best album for Blackstar at the ceremony in London’s O2 Arena.

Becoming the first artist to win posthumously at the Brit Awards, he beat Mercury Prize winner Skepta and Michael Kiwanuka to the two awards among other nominees.

Accepting the best album award on behalf of his late father, film director Duncan Jones dedicated it to “all the kooks” and spoke of Bowie’s support of unusual people.

Scottish artist Emeli Sande, who also performed at the arena, was named British female solo artist.

Nearly five years after shooting to fame with performances at the 2012 London Olympics, she scooped the prize ahead of Anohni, Ellie Goulding, Lianne La Havas, and Nao.

The British group statuette went to The 1975, a quartet from Manchester, northwest England, who swept aside Radiohead, Biffy Clyro, Bastille and Little Mix.

George Michael remembered

The ceremony was tinged with sadness as stars paid tribute to Wham! singer Michael, who died on Christmas Day last year aged 53.

His former bandmate Andrew Ridgeley gave a moving tribute, alongside pop duo Pepsi & Shirlie, which was followed by a performance of Michael’s A Different Corner by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.

Leonard Cohen, who died in November aged 82, and Prince whose death at 57 last year shocked the music world, both featured in a video of people in the industry who died during 2016.

Coldplay lost out in the British single category, which went to Little Mix for their catchy Shout Out To My Ex. The win was the first Brit award for the four-strong female group, whose performance opened the night.

The British breakthrough act award went to singer-songwriter Rag’n'Bone Man, beating hopefuls Anne-Marie, Blossoms, Skepta and Stormzy.

One Direction won the British artist video of the year for History, winning against a lengthy list of nominees including Adele — who was given a global success award during the ceremony.

Diversity among nominees

This year’s Brit Awards had sought to give greater recognition to minority artists after a backlash last year, prompting a shake-up of the judging panel and many more black nominees.

Drake won the international male solo artist category, seeing off nominees Bon Iver, Bruno Mars, Leonard Cohen and The Weeknd.

The world’s top-selling artist last year, Drake won two Grammys earlier this month and complained he had been pigeonholed as a rapper because he is black.

Beyonce claimed the title of international female solo artist — up against Christine And The Queens, Rihanna, Sia and Solange — following disappointment at the Grammys where she won just two of nine nominations.

Hip-hop pioneers A Tribe Called Quest were named best international group, beating Drake & Future, Kings Of Leon, Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds and Twenty One Pilots.

But hopes of a breakthrough across the board were dashed by Bowie, who beat four nominees from a non-white background in the male solo artist category.

Ahead of the awards ceremony Skepta praised the greater diversity among the nominees, having criticised the Brits last year.

“But this year it’s all incredible man, it’s all good things,” he told BBC television.

Brit Awards chairman Jason Iley wrote in The Times on Wednesday that “from pop to indie, grime to rock, the nominations represent a fantastic varied roll call of talent and a showcase for what’s happening in music right now”.

The ceremony ended with a performance by Robbie Williams, whose career was recognised with the icon award.

The British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid, who died in March, designed the new statuettes that were received by this year’s winners.

The British music industry contributed €4.8 billion to the UK economy in 2015, and British artists accounted for one of every six albums purchased worldwide.

Four identical calves have been born in Co Clare. The farmer couldn't be happier,"ON SUNDAY, FOUR identical calves were born at a farm outside Ennistymon, Co Clare.

The odds of such a birth are about a billion to one, according to geneticists who calculated the chances after a similar situation in Norfolk, England over a decade ago.

Today, “the proudest farmer in Ireland” Tom Clair spoke to Áine Lawlor on RTÉ’s News at One about the unlikely birth of the identical quadruplets.

He’d been expecting the cow to have twins, due to her size. Clair had last checked on the cow late on Saturday night and thought she’d make it to the morning without giving birth.

“I came down then at half seven on Sunday morning,” he said, “and when I got down there were two calves standing in front of her.”

Then, the farmer noticed a third calf lying by the cow’s side. So, he put the three together before he heard a “another little moo”.

I looked down at the three, and knew the little moo wasn’t coming from them.

“There he was then standing outside in the yard,” Clair said. “It was unbelievable, Áine.”

When asked if he felt like he won the Lotto when he saw the fourth, he said that you get a lot more satisfaction out of a calf any day than you would from winning the Lotto.

The mother of the four is a Hereford cross while the father is a Charolais bull.

Clair gave the mother all the credit for carrying the identical quadruplets, giving her a chance to rest by hand feeding the calves for the last few days.

The farmer added that it was a “pure novelty” for many as people from all over the area came to visit to see the calves.

Mia, Rosey, Fluffy and Jenny are doing well and, nearly a week later, Clair is still as excited as the celebrations continue in Ennistymon.",https://www.thejournal.ie/farmer-four-calves-3255239-Feb2017/,the_journal,1
Over 200 jobs to be created at two new motorway service stations,"OVER 230 NEW jobs will be created as Topaz and McDonald’s open two new motorway service stations.

The services will be placed on the M8 Cork/Dublin Road in Fermoy, Cork and the M9 Dublin/Waterford Road at Rathcrogue, Carlow.

The Fermoy development will be in direct conjunction with local developer JR Oronco and is due to open in Autumn 2017. Topaz Junction 5, M9, Co. Carlow is due to open in March 2017.

The two developments will create a combined 230 jobs, with 100 more in the construction phase.

The overall investment in the construction of both of the stations will be €14 million, with McDonald’s investing a further €2 million.

Both will be open 24 hours a day.

Niall Anderton MD of Topaz said the sites were chosen due to the popularity of the routes.

The Dublin to Cork and Dublin to Waterford routes are two of the busiest routes in Ireland, and we are excited to announce this development of two new full-service stations to serve Irish motorists.

“The development represents a very significant investment by Topaz, and we are also delighted to be able to bring a large number of jobs to both Cork and Carlow.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/service-stations-cork-carlow-3248866-Feb2017/,the_journal,1
"7,000 fathers have taken paid paternity leave since it was introduced","SOME 7,000 FATHERS have availed of the paternity benefit scheme since it was introduced last September.

The initiative allows fathers to take two weeks off work to help care for their newborns, while receiving a payment of €230 per week.

Up to the end of January, 8,184 applications for the scheme had been received, with 6,851 of these being accepted.

Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar said the number of claims received to date is broadly in line with his department’s estimation that it could receive between 20,000 and 30,000 applications annually.

Paternity benefit has the same qualifying PRSI conditionality as maternity benefit. It is only payable to employees and self-employed people who have the required number of PRSI contributions. Paid maternity leave of 26 weeks is offered to mothers.

No plans for mandatory system

Speaking in the Dáil recently, Varadkar said: “It is important to note that the legislation ensures no statutory obligation on an employer to continue to pay the normal salary during paternity leave. Employers have the option of providing a further top-up to the father’s regular salary if they so choose.

In drafting the legislation we had to be conscious, in this regard, of limiting the potential additional costs for business. However, a number of employers do top up their employees’ paternity benefit in much the same way as they offer to top up maternity benefit.

“There are a number of factors that determine the take up of any new scheme including, parental choice, whether the father or relevant parent has sufficient PRSI contributions, whether they are self-employed and can afford to take the time off from their business and, if an employee, whether or not their employer would top up their wages.”

Varadkar added that he has no plans to introduce a mandatory system of paid paternity leave.",https://www.thejournal.ie/paternity-leave-2-3267351-Mar2017/,the_journal,1
A five-star resort owned by JP McManus is creating 300 new jobs in Limerick,"A FIVE-STAR RESORT owned by Limerick multi-millionaire JP McManus has announced plans to go on a major recruitment drive.

Adare Manor hotel and golf resort will hire 300 new employees over the coming months. There are currently 50 people on the payroll.

The luxury resort is looking for new staff to work in both senior management roles and operational jobs like receptionists, laundry assistants and waiting staff.

Appointments to leadership roles will be filled by early May, while other staff members will start work from the beginning of July.

The property is owned by Limerick businessman and racehorse owner JP McManus, who bought the hotel three years ago for a reported €40 million.

According to its most recent accounts, the property reported a loss of more than €88,000 for the financial year that ended 31 December 2015.

Over the past 12 months, Adare Manor has been undergoing a major refurbishment, which is slated for completion by the end of this year.

Redevelopment

As well as giving the hotel’s exterior a makeover, the renovation will see 40 new rooms come on stream. This will bring the total number of bedrooms to 104.

There will also be a new ballroom that can accommodate up to 350 guests. Other additions include a new spa, swimming pool, boardroom and cinema. The surrounding 800 acres of gardens and walking trails will be redeveloped as well.

Acclaimed golf course designer Tom Fazio has been hired to redesign the property’s golf course, which will open in September.

He has designed a number of golf courses across North and South America and refurbished the Waterville Golf Links in Co Kerry in 2006.

After its redevelopment, Adare Manor will host the JP McManus Invitational Pro-Am charity golf event in 2020.

The star-studded event, hosted by McManus, was last staged in 2010 and has raised over €100 million for charities in the mid-west of Ireland.

“A huge amount of care and attention has been taken to ensure that the renovations honour the building’s architectural heritage,” said Adare Manor chief executive Colm Hannon.

He estimated that when the refurbishment is complete, the hotel will welcome around 60,000 visitors every year.

Dublin city is getting a new tenement museum this summer,"SEVENTEEN FAMILIES ONCE lived at Number 14, Henrietta Street in Dublin’s north inner city.

The old Georgian building was first converted into a tenement in the late-1800s. The large spacious rooms were partitioned into smaller ‘compact 3-roomed flats’.

These ‘flats’ commanded hefty rents at the time, and entire large families would all live in each one. In one case 13 family members lived in one flat in the building.

The 1901 and 1911 census records show 100 people living in the building.

There were two toilets between these 100 people to use. The building had no internal plumbing and there was just one water supply for tenants in the basement.

“Imagine living on the top floor and having to bring a basin of water up to wash clothes or do anything,” says Charles Duggan, heritage officer with Dublin City Council.

It would be no easy task.

The last families left the No 14 Henrietta Street in 1979, by then the building had fallen into disrepair.

“Effectively the tenement history ended at that point,” says Duggan.

Restoration

No 14 Henrietta Street is due to officially open this summer as a museum charting tenement life in Dublin.

The old four-storey Georgian building has a long and interesting history, and conservationists hope it will be the ideal location for an interactive museum experience charting Dublin’s past.

“The museum seeks to deepen the understanding of the history of urban life and housing in Ireland and more specifically in Dublin through people and memory,” says Duggan, who has been one of the key people behind the project.

Historical exhibitions, re-creations of individual flats, recorded testimonies and collected belongings of people who have lived in the building will all be used to paint of picture of tenement life in the building.

Over 200 new balusters had to be made for the back stairs during the restoration. Source: 14 Henrietta Street via Facebook

“Our collection is the building and the memories that are contained in it,” says Duggan.

The museum will also use No 14 as a jumping-off point to explore the social history of Dublin more broadly in the period covered.

Much of the original building still remains along with fittings and fixtures that have been added throughout the centuries. Things like the floorboards and the wallpaper tell the story of the building in different time periods.

Charles points to one example of how lifting the original 18th century floorboards uncovered a wealth of historical objects.

“We lifted all of the original floorboards from the house as we had to do a huge amount of structural work to the floors themselves to make them safe for museum use.

And we found a huge number of objects that peopel had just discarded over time and that just fell between cracks of the floor.

A betting slip from the 40s, a Christmas raffle ticket from 1927, somebody’s old Maths homework, lots Guinness bottles and shoe polish are just some of the objects found which tell the story of the building.

It’s just incredible the amount of material we have just found accidentally under the floorboards.

Restoration

The road to opening the museum has been a long and difficult one, with the building requiring years of painstaking work to bring it up to where it is not.

Due to the historical importance of the building and the street, Dublin City Council were prompted to put a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) on the building and acquired ownership of it in 2001.

From there, a conservation report was published for the entire Henrietta Street area due to its important historical and cultural heritage. Henrietta Street is known as one of the first Georgian Street in Dublin and possess a heritage and importance because of this.

Emergency works undertaken by Charles and his team involved completely dismantling the basement and rebuilding it, repairing the roof structure, cutting a repairing rot in the walls and more.

The design of the museum was undertaken by Shaffrey Associates and it is curated by Dr Ellen Rowley.

Charles says that the goal of this work has always been The purpose of this work has always been “to do as much as necessary and as little as possible” with the building.

The work has been documented via photographs and video and the work can be followed on the 14 Henrietta Street Facebook page.

“It’s a privilege to work on and when the museum opens that’s really just the beginning of our story,” says Charles.

Our President on a BMX? Here's the story behind that famous photo,"https://www.facebook.com/MDPStudios/photos/a.362544013791999.82504.109986249047778/1194890970557295/?type=3&theater

IT’S ONE OF the most iconic photos of President Michael D. Higgins.

The image shows our President perched over a BMX as two young men on either side of him prepare to whoosh down a halfpipe. It’s been shared too many times to count and gone viral on Reddit on several occasions, most recently in the wake of Trump’s election.

The incongruous setting, his miniature stature, his stance on the bike — the photo is nothing short of a joy and frequently pointed to as proof that we have the best president. (Take that, Trump.)

noTHING WILL EVER BEAT THE PICTURE OF MICHAEL D ON THE BMX — hot daddy seb (@giornogiovannas) December 24, 2014 Source: hot daddy seb /Twitter

But what’s the story behind the photo?

Michael Donnelly is a freelance photographer based in Co. Kildare. He explained to DailyEdge.ie how the photo came about.

It was at Sea Sessions and he was on the presidential campaign. I bumped into him and I asked him if he would do a photograph.

At the time, Sea Sessions was hosting an area devoted to BMXing and skateboarding, and so Donnelly suggested that Higgins hop on a BMX for the laugh. Higgins kindly obliged and an iconic image was born.

As a freelance photographer, however, Donnelly wasn’t on assignment and the image was taken on spec in the hope that one of the newspapers would purchase it the next day. Amazingly, nobody took him up on it.

Not one paper would use it. There you go.

Whoops! We couldn't find this Tweet

Aware that he had something special on his hands, Donnelly shared the image on Facebook and it quickly spread like wildfire across the image.

Donnelly explained to DailyEdge.ie that the image was shared on Reddit and other sites, which he wasn’t initially pleased about, given that it directly impacted his livelihood and ability to sell the photograph.

It was very much out of my power and I was annoyed as a freelance photographer, but it had just taken on a life of its own.

He added that he was a little irked by people on the internet defacing the photo by “changing it to a tricyle or a motorbike” or “adding rainbows to make him look like a leprechaun”.

Following Higgins’ election, Donnelly bumped into him on several occasions, including at Sea Sessions where they had this priceless encounter.

We met up and I shook his hand. He said, ‘Would you like me to get on the bike again? I just had the hip done.’

A few months later, Donnelly found himself at an event in Trinity College where he was photographing Sinead O’Connor. Knowing that President Michael D. Higgins and Sabina were also in attendance, Donnelly brought along a framed copy of the copy.

I met himself and Sabina, and I brought the photograph and presented it to him. It was Michael D meets Michael D.

Imagine. There’s a photo of Michael D on a BMX hanging up somewhere in the Áras.

At the end of the day, Donnelly says that he’s immensely proud of the photo and that “everyone knows it” even if they don’t know who’s responsible for it.

And to think no newspaper ran with it back in 2011.

Their loss. Our gain.

'It's a vote of confidence': A major Wicklow film studio plans to grow five times in size,"ASHFORD STUDIOS HAS unveiled major expansion plans for its operations in Wicklow, with the film facility to swell to more than five times its current size if the project is cleared.

The company is one of Ireland’s three major film studios. Ireland’s largest film studio, Ardmore, is located in Bray, while a third, Troy, has recently been opened in Limerick.

Ashford recently applied to Wicklow County Council for a 700,000 sq ft expansion at its base, located south of Bray, that has the potential to create hundreds of new jobs.

This would include the construction 12 new buildings to house four new film stages, more office space, a television studio, a visitor’s centre, a makeup room and set construction sites.

The application said that the development would include the demolition of an existing agricultural building covering about 1,000 sq m, the provision of 648 ancillary staff, 200 car parking spaces and 101 coach parking spaces.

Ashford, which opened in 2012, currently has about 150,000 sq ft of space, of which just under 60,000 sq ft consists of film stages.

Ashford

The facility has already housed big-budget productions such as Irish-Canadian co-produced historical drama Vikings. The studio employs about 450 people during large productions.

Ashford founder Joe O’Connell used his own money to finance the initial 150,000 sq ft development, which is estimated to have cost €25 million to build. O’Connell originally told Wicklow council of his plans to expand the site in 2014.

Hit show Vikings was filmed at Ashford Source: Youtube

The council is due to make a decision on the application in April. If the development is approved, Ashford would become a more significant competitor to local rival Ardmore. Ardmore, Ireland’s largest film studio, is currently up for sale.

The news will likely come as a relief to Wicklow locals, for whom the sale of Ardmore has lead to concerns about the film industry’s future in the town.

Ardmore fears

The sector is a major one for Wicklow and provides a large amount of local employment.

There were fears that developers may buy the Ardmore site with a view to turning it into a housing development, although Wicklow councillors have said they have no intention of allowing this to happen.

Independent councillor and Bray district Leas-Cathaoirleach Christopher Fox told Fora that Ashford’s application is good news for the area.

“Joe O’Connell has been engaging with Wicklow County Council about a future expansion at Ashford and councillors have zoned land accordingly to facilitate that expansion,” he said.

“It is a vote (of confidence). Wicklow is the home of the Irish film industry and it’s great to see Ashford expanding.

“There is a huge amount of spin-off employment, the whole local economy benefits. Typically a planning application will take six months, hopefully this will be done and dusted quickly.”

App that encourages children with autism to make eye contact wins at BT Young Scientist Business Bootcamp,"AN APP THAT encourages children with autism to make eye contact won best overall team at the 8th annual BT Young Scientist Business Bootcamp.

Mi Contact is based on applied behaviour analysis to enhance early intervention programmes.

A group of teenagers from Galway, Cork, Kilkenny, Offaly and Dublin have claimed the winning spot at the 2017 BT Young Scientist Business Bootcamp with their project entitled Mi Contact.

The winners were selected by a judging panel of business professionals following an intensive four day workshop at NovaUCD.

During the Bootcamp, the students, selected because they displayed particular business ambition, are shown how to set up a company, write a business plan, create a marketing campaign, draft a budget and present their ideas competently to senior academics and business people.

The group was selected for their significant progress over the four-day Bootcamp, which is designed to equip students with practical skills and knowledge to transform a creative idea into a viable business proposition.

The winner were Ciara-Beth Ni Ghríofa (17) from Coláiste an Eachréidh, Galway, Ella Brennan (16) from Loreto Secondary School, Kilkenny, George Hennessy (17) from Midleton College, Cork, Lucy Leonard (15) from Tullamore College, Offaly and Steven Harris (18) from Luttrellstown Community College, Dublin.

The Bootcamp is designed and delivered by BT Ireland and University College Dublin.

here's what happened when we tried,"THE CONDITIONS ARE clear, there is barely a cloud in the sky and a Boeing 737-800 is cruising east above Dublin Bay.

Oh, and I’m flying it.

Luckily for people on the ground and off it, I’m not in an actual plane and nobody is counting on me to land the 130 tonne aircraft.

Instead I’m in a warehouse a short drive from Dublin Airport at Simtech’s facility, safely ensconced in the right-hand seat of their 737 simulator, which is used to train pilots from all over the world. Simtech is a specialist provider of flight simulation and pilot training services and was founded by Sé Pardy and Fergal Keogh, in 2004. They recently sold a stake in their business to private equity firm Renatus Capital Partners and Martello Group, a specialist aviation, leisure and real estate group.

Beside me is Bob Sheehan, the company’s engineering manager, who has worked on these simulators for nearly 40 years. He says that while not a pilot himself, he would class himself as the next most qualified person most flights he’s been on.

After showing me the circuit, Bob turns the simulator over to me. With him watching, I take the plane up to 3,000 feet and around 25 miles from the runway before turning around. The simulator itself doesn’t move, but the experience makes you feel like it is. The simulators are programmed using the data and parameters from test flights. It’s as real as you would expect a €9 million piece of equipment to be.

By now, there are a number of things going through my head. Firstly, this is difficult. Which is probably obvious and I was under no illusions that it would be easy, but the sheer level of instruments and information that a pilot looks at and receives is massive and ever-changing.

This journalist, awkwardly sitting in the First Officer's seat.

The other thing that’s painfully obvious is that controlling the plane is physically tiring. The steering column is heavy but responsive. Bob likens the movements to a car’s steering wheel. When you start driving, you think that you have to pull the wheel back and forth, but you soon realise that subtle movements will do that.

A jet’s steering column is similar except: a) there are four directions you can go and you have to pay attention to them all and b) the plane weighs about 174,200 pounds and is contending with wind, weather and atmospheric pressure so doesn’t always go exactly where you’d like it to.

Training

The simulators form a vital part of pilot training, be they cadets (Aer Lingus, Stobart Air and Cityjet have simulators on-site) or those taking the step up from smaller planes to jets.

Many will spend four-hour blocks being run through everything from taking off in great weather to landing on one engine. The training is intensive, but it has to be, given the nature of the job.

Source: Statista

That job being one that is in huge demand. The global boom in air travel means that Europe alone needs a lot of new pilots. According to Boeing, the world’s largest aeroplane manufacturer, 104,000 new commercial airline pilots will be needed in Europe over the next 20 years. UK regional airline Flybe recently confirmed that the airline’s expansion plans are being held back by a shortage of trained pilots. Last February, US airline group Republic Airways filed for bankruptcy, blaming a pilot shortage for forcing it to ground planes.

While airlines used to fund training in the past now it is, primarily, trainee pilots themselves who finance their own training. This has resulted in a growing trend of people who have had financially successful careers in technology or finance industries, for example, using their earnings to fund their training.

With that in mind a pilot training exhibition, Pilot Careers Live will take place in Croke Park Conference Centre on Saturday 4 March. It will feature talks on training and the working life of a pilot.

Pilot Brian O’Keeffe graduated as a commercial pilot last year after training with Atlantic Flight Training Academy. He now works with Norwegian Airlines flying primarily from Oslo.

“I worked in Australia so that I could finance my training. I would urge anyone interested in a career as a pilot to take the plunge and follow your dreams; it’s a fantastic career. Pilot Careers Live is a great first step where you will learn about how to make your dreams a reality.”

Coming in to land

For Bob, the aviation industry is one of those things you “either love or you don’t”. He’s imparting this knowledge at the same time as guiding me in to Dublin Airport.

Essentially, there is a green rectangle on one instrument known as the localiser, which gives you the centre spot of the runway. As the pilot, you’re trying to line yourself up with that, while occasionally checking the horizon.

Then you’re keeping an eye on the attitude indicator:

Those pink bars supposed to line up with that small black box, but the lines move around, requiring constant slight but firm corrections.

You’re also watching your glideslope, a pink diamond that comes into view closer to the runway, your airspeed, your altitude and various other inputs as well as your heading and the horizon.

As I glide in, I notice that the centre spot of Runway 28 is not exactly in the centre of the plane. So, either they’ve moved the runway, the instruments are wrong or I’ve made a mess of this.

With just around 1,000 feet left, Bob is reminding me to shade to the right – but not too far to the right. With a descent rate of 700 feet a minute, there’s not a lot of time for adjustments or to look at the Poolbeg towers or the Old Airport Road lovingly recreated on my left.

I desperately try to guide the plane to the concrete and then there’s a small bump and, with the barest of margins, the back wheels, or “main bogeys” hit solid ground, avoiding the grass.

Letting Bob handle the parking, I relax for the first time in our short 20-minute flight. My arms are tired from the column and my mind is exhausted from information overload and total concentration.

But I can also see why pilots love flying.

Leo Varadkar hails 'results of government policies' as unemployment rate dips below 7%,"MINISTER FOR SOCIAL Protection Minister Leo Varadkar has taken an opportunity to praise the actions of his own department as figures published today show a continuing trend of lower unemployment rates across the country.

As Leo Varadkar enters a grassroots battle with Simon Coveney for the Fine Gael leadership, he is making the most of what he called a “significant result for the many individuals and families who were blighted by the crash years”.

“[It] shows that our policies to tackle unemployment are getting results,” said Varadkar.

“This government intends to make even more progress in the year ahead.”

Data released by the Department of Social Protection shows the number of people who are unemployed in Ireland now stands at 147,400, with the monthly seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for January at 6.8%.

Long-term unemployment is also down to 79,700 and youth unemployment also fell from 18.9% to 15.2%.

The fall in unemployment has been a trend in recent months with December seeing the lowest unemployment rate – 7.2% or 157,700 people - since the economic crash.

A bullish Varadkar continued, “This year I intend to move more people from welfare to work, and make more progress towards our long-term target of reducing unemployment to 5-6%, and reducing long-term unemployment to below 2.5%.”

The Quarterly National Household Survey found that employment increased by 65,100 in the year to the fourth quarter of 2016. The current number of people employed in Ireland now stands at 2,048,100.

The minister is now looking to develop a new work experience programme to replace JobBridge that will involve one-to-one engagement with jobseekers, promoting self-employment as well as using initiatives like JobsWeek to match jobseekers with employees.",https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-unemployment-lowest-eight-years-3251017-Feb2017/,the_journal,1

Are you on a job hunt in Dublin or Louth? New jobs are on the way,"IN TWO SEPARATE announcements today, 230 jobs were announced in the east of the country, with Drogheda and Dublin set to benefit.

Drogheda

Mobile Technologies announced that it would create 150 jobs in Drogheda, as it establishes its European headquarters there over the next three years.

The company specialises in mobile device display technologies, and celebrates its 40th year in business this year.

A ceremony was held to mark the news today in the Louth town, with Minister for Jobs Mary Mitchell O’Connor, Mobile Technologies CEO Chris Remy and Drogheda Mayor Oliver Tully among those in attendance.

Remy said he welcomed the IDA’s help in choosing Drogheda as the location for its new headquarters and said that they were setting up in Ireland for its “technology savvy workforce, attractive business environment and its membership of the EU”.

Dublin

Courier service Deadline announced a further 80 new permanent jobs for its headquarters in Dublin city centre, with all set to be filled by the summer of 2018.

Over the next few years, the company expects to grow its workforce from 35 to well over 120.

Founded in 2010, Deadline offers a range of transport and delivery services to locations in Ireland and also internationally.

Its CEO Stephen McCann said that the company was set up at the height of the recession and, after doing well in recent years, had a “real, immediate need to fill these new positions”.",https://www.thejournal.ie/new-jobs-3-3265271-Mar2017/,the_journal,1
Back from the dead: Nokia relaunches the iconic 3310,"FINNISH PHONE MAKER Nokia launched three new Android smartphones and unveiled a revamped version of its iconic 3310 model yesterday, more than a decade after it was phased out.

Unlike the original, which was known for its sturdiness, the new Nokia 3310 will allow web browsing.

The new version will bring back its predecessor’s popular Snake game and distinctive ringtones, said Arto Nummela, the head of Finnish start-up HMD Global which will produce the phone under a licensing agreement with Nokia.

“The telephone will allow you to talk for 22 hours, ten times more than the original,” he said during a presentation in Barcelona on the eve of the start of the Mobile World Congress, the world’s biggest mobile phone show.

The new version of the Nokia 3310 was launched today Source: Martin Landi PA Wire/PA Images

Launched in 2000, Nokia’s original 3310 sold nearly 120 million units worldwide before it was discontinued in 2005, making it one of the world’s best-selling mobile phones.

Analysts said resurrecting the popular model was a clever way for HMD Global to relaunch Nokia’s brand.

“HMD launched three new smartphones and an iconic mobile. It is a way to create a halo effect around the other models by reviving talk about the Nokia brand,” said Thomas Husson, a mobile analyst at Forrester.

In addition to the new 3310, HMD presented three new smartphones, the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 which will sell for different prices.

The Nokia 6 was already available in China and will now go on sale globally.

“We think (Nokia) could take 5 percent of the global smartphone market by the end of 2019. But it needs to get big quick or it won’t work,” said CCS Insight’s device specialist and chief of research, Ben Wood.

Nokia was the world’s top mobile maker between 1998 and 2011 but was overtaken by South Korean rival Samsung after failing to respond to the rapid rise of smartphones.

Its telephone brand remains widely recognised, especially in developing markets.

Now a leading telecom equipment maker, Nokia sold its entire handset business to Microsoft Corp in 2014.

Last year HMD bought Microsoft Mobile’s handset business and the right to use the Nokia brand.

Under the agreement, Nokia will receive royalty payments from HMD for sales of every Nokia branded mobile phone or tablet.

Apple Pay is now available in Ireland,"The service is now avaialble through two irish banks.

The service is now avaialble through two irish banks.

OVER TWO YEARS after it was first launched, Apple Pay is now available in Ireland.

The cash-free payment system allows users to pay for goods by tapping their phone on a reader, much like they would using a contactless card.

Apple Pay in Ireland is currently available for customers of KBC Bank and Ulster Bank and there is no charge per transaction on the service.

The security of the service comes from the fact that your actual card numbers are not stored on the device and are therefore not transferred when you make a payment.

Instead, you’re issued a Device Account Number that is encrypted and stored in your device.

The only time your debit or credit card details are seen by Apple is when you’re entering it into your phone.

It’s much like generating a new voucher for every transaction you make. Each one is for the specific transaction you make and even if it is intercepted, the token cannot be traced back to the buyer.

You can also use Apple Pay to pay for goods and services in apps on your device.

You can begin using Apple Pay through the Wallet app on your Apple device.

It is available on an iPhone 6 or later, iPhone SE, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3 or later and an Apple Watch paired to an iPhone 5 or later.

Android Pay has also been available to Irish uses since December 2016.",https://www.thejournal.ie/apple-pay-ireland-3274316-Mar2017/,the_journal,1
Starving teenage boy rescued 'by chance' after nearly two weeks at sea without food,"A HELICOPTER PILOT scanning remote northern Pacific waters for tuna was stunned to find not one but two boats carrying castaways who had been adrift for weeks.

The pilot, operating the chopper from a trawler off the Marshall Islands, came across the boats by chance last week, leading to the rescue of three fishermen and a teenage boy, the Marshall Islands Journal reported.

It said both boats had set off from Kiribati, about 650 kilometres away.

The one with three fishermen aboard had been adrift for 28 days, while the lone 14 year old in the other had been lost for 11 days.

Ocean currents had brought both boats within eight kilometres of each other but they were unaware of the other’s existence until they were spotted and rescued.

The trawler Kwila888 picked up the drifters and cut short its tuna fishing trip to drop them in the Marshalls’ capital Majuro last weekend, the Journal reported.

The trawler’s captain Yuan Tsai Chen said the teenager had not eaten during his 11-day ordeal and the fishermen survived by catching sharks and fish.

They were taken to hospital after arriving in Majuro and pronounced healthy, with one person suffering mild dehydration.

Epic tales of survival are not uncommon in the northern Pacific, where tiny islands are separated by vast expanses of ocean.

In January 2014, Salvadoran fisherman Jose Alvarenga washed up in the Marshalls, more than 13 months after he set off from Mexico’s west coast with a companion, who died during the voyage.

The five Operation Transformation leaders have lost a lot of weight in eight weeks,"The five leaders have lost 10 stone between them in two months

The five leaders have lost 10 stone between them in two months

THE FIVE LEADERS on the RTÉ programme Operation Transformation have collectively lost almost 10 stone in two months.

Chris McElligott, Marie Grace, Maireád Redmond, Seán Daly and Yvonne Keenan-Ross embarked on their food and exercise plans eight weeks ago and, to date, have lost a total of 9 stone 11 pounds between them.

And plenty of us tuned in to watch them do it, with an average of 441,000 people watching the show weekly.

Over the course of the show, school children all over Ireland coordinated 10 minutes of exercise at 10am on 10 February and 5,000 people joining a 5k run in the Phoenix Park.

The person who lost the most weight was Seán Daly, who started with a weight of 24 stone 3 pounds. With a final weight of 21 stone 5.5 pounds, Daly lost almost 3 stone in the eight week period.

Operation Transformation is designed to encourage people all around the country to have a healthier relationship with food and learn to love exercise, says show presenter Kathryn Thomas.

Ray D’Arcy went on the defensive of the programme’s principles on his radio show last month, when a health expert said that Operation Transformation is “worse than useless” for the people that watch it.

D’Arcy, however, retorted that the show was “part of a bigger picture” and was helping to contribute to “having conversations we weren’t having before”.

RTÉ said that the show gained a 29% share of the available audience each night it aired, drawing in an average of 441,000 people. Furthermore, there have been 285,000 streams of the show and its clips on the RTÉ Player to date.

get some inspiration from this master crêpier,"PANCAKE TUESDAY IS almost with us again.

As most people will be preparing to bin another batch of burnt flour and egg, TheJournal.ie visited someone who knows a thing or two about putting together a crepe (the pancake’s more sophisticated, mature cousin) to see if we could pick up a few tips.

Redmond Kennedy runs Classic Crepes, currently occupying a space for pop-up businesses in the window of Arnotts on Dublin’s Henry Street, usually operates from two classic Citroen HY vans, both converted into crêperies.

Kennedy explained that crepes are not too different from the humble pancake:

A crepe is a crispy, thin pancake. The ingredients are similar, but you don’t put any baking soda into it. That gives the elevation for the typical pancake we’re very much familiar with here in Ireland.

“That also goes for savory crepes, know as galletes. Again, it’s thin and crispy.”

'Drive-thru' ashes coming to Galway for the start of Lent,"A CHURCH IN Galway will take a novel approach to Ash Wednesday next week, with a drive-thru service set to be in place at Glenamady church, near the border with Roscommon.

The Irish Catholic reports that Father Paddy Mooney had met with the pastoral council, who together decided on an approach that would cater for people on-the-go to get ashes on their forehead when Lent starts next Wednesday 1 March.

The design of the church grounds will allow people to drive in one gate, stop and receive their ashes from their car, and then carry on to drive out a second gate.

The service will be available between 8am and 9.30am that morning.

The church has also installed a Lenten Petition box in the grounds where people will be able to pull in to submit prayer requests right up until Easter.

Father Mooney said: “We looked at the situation on the ground. People and families are on the move all the time.

We’re just putting [this] in front of people to help think of Lent, as a reminder of it.

On Ash Wednesday, the ashes of the palms from the last year’s Palm Sunday are placed on the heads of members of the congregation.

MERRION SQUARE IS known as a place where many artists display their work, hung on the railings around the park each weekend.

This Friday for one day only, these railings will showcase a new collection of art works – self-portraits created by Irish children.

This outdoor portrait gallery is being organised by The Ark, the cultural centre for children which is based in Temple Bar.

In March they will hold a visual arts programme in their building on Eustace Street about portraiture, but in advance of this they put out a call to children all across Ireland to be part of their outdoor gallery.

Children under 12 were invited to create their own self portrait (the more colourful the better) and take a photo of it, as high-res as possible, and send it to The Ark, Eustace Street.

The organisers had hoped to display 100 submissions, but due to the number of responses have decided to increase that over 250.

Open thread: What's the most inspiring book you've ever read?,"TODAY IS WORLD Book Day, the biggest annual celebration of books and reading in Ireland and the UK.

With that in mind, we want to hear about your favourite books.

What’s the most inspiring or life-changing book you’ve read? Or what is just a plain good read?

We’ll kick things off. Here are some of TheJournal.ie employees’ favourites:

“The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by Haruki Murakami – huge, bold storytelling that will knock any aspirations to be a novelist out of you (if you have them): how could you possibly produce something as incredibly inventive as this?”

“If you want to read two Irish books to understand our more accessible literary inheritance beyond the giants of Joyce, Wilde etc, I’d recommend That They May Face The Rising Sun by John McGahern and Country Girls by Edna O’Brien.”

Vernon God Little by DBC Pierre. A combination of brilliant, inventive, language and cutting satire. I don’t think I’ve read another book like it.

“A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again and Consider the Lobster (both by David Foster Wallace) were life-changing in the sense that they inspired me to do a thesis on DFW. Both are also extraordinary pieces of work and nice, gentle introductions to a writer who can be quite difficult and intense at times (though always worth the effort).”

1984 by George Orwell really shaped my view of how governments interact with populations, and has stuff in it that’s so fascinating to read in a 21st-century context. Also, When Panic Attacks by Aine Tubridy really allowed me to understand/get a hold on anxiety.

“Voices from Chernobyl by Svetlana Alexievich – terrifying and will give you nightmares, but it’s an amazing piece of work.”

Most definitely Tiny Beautiful Things by Cheryl Strayed. It’s a collection of her columns from when she was the online agony aunt Dear Sugar (now a podcast). In theory it sounds like nothing special but, my goodness, her answers are incredible. She’s like Oprah and a really, really kind mam all in one. It totally changed my thinking on everything from relationships to family dynamics to work stress.

“Never Mind the Bollocks: Women Rewrite Rock by Amy Raphael made me want to be a music journalist.”

The Will to Change by bell hooks was one of those “everyone should read this” books for me.

"In major announcement, Nasa confirms seven Earth-like planets have been discovered","An artist's conception of what the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system may look like Source: NASA/JPL-Caltech via AP

FOR THE FIRST time ever, astronomers have discovered seven Earth-size planets orbiting a nearby star — and these new worlds could hold life.

This cluster of planets is less than 40 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius, according to Nasa and the Belgian-led research team who announced the discovery today.

The planets circle tightly around a dim dwarf star called Trappist-1, barely the size of Jupiter.

Three are in the so-called habitable zone, where liquid water and, possibly life, might exist.

The others are right on the doorstep.

Scientists said they need to study the atmospheres before determining whether these rocky, terrestrial planets could support some sort of life.

But it already shows just how many Earth-size planets could be out there — especially in a star’s sweet spot, ripe for extraterrestrial life.

The takeaway from all this is, “we’ve made a crucial step toward finding if there is life out there,” said the University of Cambridge’s Amaury Triaud, one of the researchers.

The potential for more Earth-size planets in our Milky Way galaxy is mind-boggling.

“There are 200 billion stars in our galaxy,” said co-author Emmanuel Jehin of the University of Liege. “So do an account. You multiply this by 10, and you have the number of Earth-size planets in the galaxy — which is a lot.”

Last spring, the University of Liege’s Michael Gillon and his team reported finding three planets around Trappist-1. Now the count is up to seven, and Gillon said there could be more. Their latest findings appear in the journal Nature.

This compact solar system is reminiscent of Jupiter and its Galilean moons, according to the researchers.

Picture this: If Trappist-1 were our sun, all seven planets would be inside Mercury’s orbit. Mercury is the innermost planet of our own solar system.

The ultracool star at the heart of this system would shine 200 times dimmer than our sun, a perpetual twilight as we know it.

And the star would glow red — maybe salmon-colored, the researchers speculate.

“The spectacle would be beautiful because every now and then, you would see another planet, maybe about as big as twice the moon in the sky, depending on which planet you’re on and which planet you look at,” Triaud said yesterday in a teleconference with reporters.

Tiny, cold stars like Trappist-1 were long shunned by exoplanet-hunters (exoplanets are those outside our solar system).

Artist's conception of what the surface of Trappist-1 might look like Source: NASA/JPL-Caltech via AP

But the Belgian astronomers decided to seek them out, building a telescope in Chile to observe 60 of the closest ultracool dwarf stars. Their Trappist telescope lent its name to this star.

While faint, the Trappist-1 star is close by cosmic standards, allowing astronomers to study the atmospheres of its seven temperate planets. All seven look to be solid like Earth — mostly rocky and possibly icy, too.

They all appear to be tidally locked, which means the same side continually faces the star, just like the same side of our moon always faces us. Life could still exist at these places, the researchers explained.

“Here, if life managed to thrive and releases gases similar to that that we have on Earth, then we will know,” Triaud said.

Chemical analyses should indicate life with perhaps 99 percent confidence, Gillon noted. But he added: “We will never be completely sure” without going there.",https://www.thejournal.ie/nasa-new-planets-3253525-Feb2017/,the_journal,1
Driver thinks he's being stopped for speeding,"Source: Twitter/An Garda Síochána

A CO GALWAY cat had a lucky escape earlier today when an eagle-eyed garda spotted her head stuck in the engine grille of a car – a car that was in motion.

The plucky feline was noticed by a motorcycle garda who passed the car in traffic.

It was a close-run thing for the furry interloper – the driver, who is not believed to be the cat’s owner and initially thought he was being stopped for speeding, was on his way to Clare, a drive of over an hour in length.

Once the car was stopped, the cat was discovered to have its head firmly wedged between the grille. Thankfully, after a deal of dismantling, she was rescued uninjured, gardaí said in a tweet.

Cats will often climb under car bonnets, attracted by the warmth of the engine. It makes a snug, if highly dangerous, place for a nap.

The Irish Girl Guides is to start allowing transgender children into their ranks,"The Irish Girl Guides says it will now consult with its members.

The Irish Girl Guides says it will now consult with its members.

TRANSGENDER CHILDREN WHO are male on their birth cert but who self-identify as female will be allowed to join the Irish Girl Guides.

The 106-year-old organisation has confirmed that they agreed over the weekend to amend their rules after a transgender member contacted them last year.

The Irish Girl Guides says it will give effect to the decision by amending its equality policy guidelines to include the fact that “anyone who lives their lives as female is welcome to join.”

The Irish Girl Guides accepts children from the age of five and members are part of the Ladybirds at age 5-7 years, the Brownies at age 7-10 years and the Guides at age 10-14 years. After that they can remain in the Senior Branch at age 14-30 years.

The decision to admit transgender children into their membership comes after a similar decision was made by the Girlguiding UK last week. The Irish Girl Guides says their decision was coincidental to that which was taken in the UK.

With the decision now made to admit transgender girls into their ranks, the Irish Girl Guides says it will develop guidelines to about how to welcome such children.

"'It was such a shock, I no longer feel 61 but 22 again': Barry's delight at scooping major book award","Sebastian Barry posing with the award at last night's ceremony.

Sebastian Barry posing with the award at last night's ceremony.

LAST NIGHT, SEBASTIAN Barry won the prestigious Costa Book of the Year award for the second time, with his book Days Without End scooping him the prize on this occasion.

The 61-year-old had previously won the award in 2008 for The Secret Scripture.

Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Barry detailed what inspired him to write the book, how its tale of anti-immigration in the US strikes similar chords today, and his sheer shock and delight at winning the award.

The idea for the book came when his teenage son Toby told his parents that he was gay.

Barry had noticed a cause of disquiet in his son and it was when “the philosopher of the family”, Toby’s older sister, pushed him to tell the family that this mood lifted.

While not directly influencing the plot, Barry said that the experience inspired him to make “the devoted love of two men” essential to the plot of Days Without End.

The book centres on an Irish immigrant fleeing the Famine in the 1850s who faces a strong anti-immigrant stance when he arrives in the US.

When researching the history, Barry kept coming across situations and rhetoric mirroring the modern situation in the US.

“To hear all these ancient conversations about immigrants in America in the 1850s,” he said, “that are the ones you’re hearing fresh, as if for the first time, when you’re writing the book” was astonishing for Barry.

While America was built on strong ideals, Barry said the issue of violence across American history appeared again and again while he was researching this book.

The history of America is to honour these extraordinary ideals. We do, in a sense, love America because of that struggle. What is dismaying about recent history is that some people seem to have discarded these core principles.

“For me, in that moment, an idea of America begins to die. I think that’s why we’re all so terrified.”

When it came to the awards announcement yesterday, Barry had gone into the ceremony feeling downbeat about his chances.

He said: “I was practising that strange, unfamiliar discipline of realising, soberly and sensibly, that there was no chance of winning a prize like that twice.

I had talked myself into a joyful reaction to someone else’s good news so I was completely shocked. It’s a shock that reaches down into your oldest reserves of joy.

In terms of his own writing, it is the work of younger Irish writers that invigorates and stimulates his own work.

He praised writers such as Lisa McInerney and Donal Ryan for their “adventures in syntax and language” and detailed how he dispensed with his usual manner of writing for Days Without End.

Writing this book was a new adventure for the renowned author, and one which he relished.

“I no longer feel 61,” Barry concluded, “but 22 again.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/barry-award-3216765-Feb2017/,the_journal,1

IRISH AUTHOR SEBASTIAN Barry has won the 2016 Costa Book of the Year for his novel Days Without End.

The win was announced this evening and is the second time Dublin-born Barry has won the award after picking it up for The Secret Scripture in 2008.

The award was launched in 1971 and was previously known as the Whitbread Book Award. It recognises authors based in the UK and Ireland.

There are five categories – First Novel, Novel, Biography, Poetry and Children’s Book – with one of the five winners chosen as Book of the Year.

Barry’s winning book is set in the mid-19th century United States and is about two brothers-in-arms who fight in the Indian wars and ultimately the Civil War.

Despite the horrors they face, the book also deals with happiness, courage and love.

The Costa Book of the Year Judges described Days Without End as:

A miracle of a book – both epic and intimate – that manages to create spaces for love and safety in the noise and chaos of history.

A resident of Co. Wicklow, Barry has also won the Kerry Group Irish Fiction Prize and the Irish Book Awards Novel of the Year.

The Arts Council this evening congratulated Barry on his win.

“Sebastian Barry is a writer of tremendous talent. Days Without End is as compelling as it is moving, as lyrical as it is inventive,” said Arts Council Chair Sheila Pratschke.

“Barry’s commitment to the craft of writing has long been recognised in Ireland and abroad, and it is a thrill to see his latest novel win such acclaim.”

Pratschke also noted that there was other Irish success at the awards:

The Arts Council was also delighted to see Irish writers Jess Kidd and Billy O’Callaghan taking first and second place in the Costa Short Story Competition, and Irish-based author Brian Conaghan winning the 2016 Costa Children’s Book Award.

One concrete benefit of Brexit: The Passport Office is hiring extra staff,"Source: Sam Boal

THE PASSPORT OFFICE is recruiting extra staff to cope with a surge in demand in response to last year’s Brexit vote in the UK.

The Department of Foreign Affairs said that while it did not compile reasons why people applied for passports, it was reasonable to assume that the vote to leave the European Union was a factor in the increase in demand from Britain and Northern Ireland.

Applications from the North were up by 77% in January, compared to the same month last year. Demand from Britain was up by over 70% on the January 2015 figure.

Source: Dept Foreign Affairs

It comes amid continuing political turmoil in London over planned Brexit negotiations. There are concerns that UK passport holders will lose benefits like freedom to work anywhere in the union, in the wake of the country’s exit.

Brexit minister David Davis said this week he expects the government to meets its end-of-March deadline to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, kicking off the formal exit negotiation process.

Other factors

Back here, other factors leading to an increase in passport demand over the last year include a large number of Irish citizens travelling for last summers Euros, and a spike in applications in 2006 feeding through in renewals ten years later.

“Early indicators in 2017 are showing that increased demand for passports is likely to be sustained, certainly in the immediate future,” Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan said.

“We are in the course of delivering a major Passport Reform Programme which will ensure significant customer service improvements to benefit citizens in the near future.

“This includes the introduction of online adult renewals which will mean a more efficient service for applicants. I expect to start rolling out this programme before the end of March this year.”

To respond to the increase in demand the Passport Service is recruiting over 230 Temporary Clerical Officers, over half of which are already in place, Flanagan said.

I am carefully monitoring passport services and discussed the matter with my officials today.

A new app wants to help you find car parking space in Dublin,"The app was launched in Dublin today. Source: Leon Farrell/RollingNews.ie

A NEW APP has been released that seeks to make it easier for motorists in Dublin to find a parking space.

The app gathers the most up-to-date information about available parking spaces and then directs motorists to them while avoiding traffic and diversions.

The app is developed by Dublin city business group DublinTown and is available on both iOS and Android platforms.

The app takes information from city, private and hotel carparks and was developed in collaboration with Dublin City Council, the National Transport Authority and city businesses.

The CEO of the DublinTown business group Richard Guiney says that the app is particularly timely given the traffic problems Dublin is enduring during Luas construction and the changes to traffic flow that will persist afterwards.

“The city is and will remain very much open and accessible to all forms of transport including cars, however, there is a need to educate the public how to get to their chosen destination,” Guiney says.

Skellig Coast tourism plan launched to capitalise on Star Wars interest,"FÁILTE IRELAND HAS today launched a new plan for the Skellig Coast area of Kerry aimed at capitalising on the massive interest generated by 2015′s Star Wars movie.

The Skellig Islands saw a huge boost in global interest after they were featured in the reboot of Star Wars franchise.

Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens features the larger island Skellig Michael, and the beautiful landscape was given global attention throughout the filming of the move.

It will also feature in the upcoming sequel Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi.

People have since flocked to visit the small island, which is home to a former monastery and also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Now, Irish tourism organisation Fáilte Ireland wants to capitalise on that interest and spread it around the entire Skellig Coast area. It today announced its visitor experience plan aimed at increasing “dwell time in the wider region surrounding the iconic attraction”.

“This project is all about widening the current visitor experience from just simply being ‘a trip to Skellig Michael’ to a more immersive engagement with ‘the Skelligs Experience’,” said Orla Carroll, director of strategic development with Fáilte Ireland.

Projects to achieve this goal include:

Journeys inspired by the history of the Skellig Monks

The Cradle of Ireland’s Nationhood (centred on Daniel O’Connell’s birthplace)

A history of global connections

Where the ocean meets the sky at the edge of the world (incorporating the ‘dark skies’ experience)

A group of different concerned organisations are also coming together under the umbrella of the Skellig Coast Tourism Network.

The purpose of this group will be to represent and coordinate the interests of the various local companies working within the tourism sector.",https://www.thejournal.ie/skellig-coast-tourism-3204249-Jan2017/,the_journal,1
"Two leading charities, Oxfam Ireland and GOAL, enter into merger negotiations","TWO LEADING IRISH charities, Oxfam Ireland and GOAL, are entering discussions surrounding a possible merger of the two organisations.

The move comes after the boards of both organisations agreed to explore the possibility of an amalgamation into what could become a global development agency called Oxfam GOAL.

If the plan goes ahead the new agency will be headquartered in Ireland.

It is not yet known whether there will be job losses between the two organisations, but it is believed that there may need to be a reduction in staff numbers to avoid duplication of positions.

Oxfam Ireland chief executive Jim Clarken said, “We are very excited by the prospect of a successful merger. GOAL’s action-oriented approach and first responder ethos is core to their DNA and has saved millions of lives.

Oxfam’s approach of practical action and people-led response, challenging the structures and systems that keep people locked in poverty, has led to real change across the world. Bringing our organisations together will increase our scale, which means we can deliver greater impact for people in poverty and in crisis.

Commenting on the proposed merger, GOAL general manager Celine Fitzgerald said, “In looking to its future, GOAL has assessed the merits of continuing as a standalone entity or achieving a step change in scale and impact in the delivery of humanitarian support and advocacy.

“A merger with Oxfam would create a strong organisation in Ireland with a true global reach, saving and changing the lives of millions of the poorest and most vulnerable people on our planet for the better.”

According to one source, GOAL started looking at its options last autumn and began talking to Oxfam which has since progressed into formal negotiations.

If the merger is to go ahead both organisations will continue with their respective aid plans while ‘assessing how to combine the best of both organisations to increase the overall reach and impact of resources and programmes.’

Clarken added, “As we begin a robust due diligence exercise and examine the possibility of a merger over the coming weeks, I’d like to assure our donors and supporters that we will continue with our life-saving and life-changing work as normal.”

Last month, GOAL announced 25 redundancies across its office in Dublin and London. The charity said at the time that the redundancies were necessary due to a ‘tighter funding environment’ while aiming to prioritise their relief efforts.

Both organisations have a history of working in Ireland. This year, GOAL is celebrating its 40th anniversary in Ireland and Oxfam has been operating in Ireland since the 1950s.

It is believed that if the merger is to go ahead, the process could take up to a year to complete.",http://www.thejournal.ie/oxfam-ireland-goal-merger-3239799-Feb2017/,the_journal,1
'I'm back from the brink': Ex-Liverpool defender making good progress after lucky escape,"FORMER CAMEROON CAPTAIN Rigobert Song is fit again after a narrow brush with death when suffering a stroke in early October, he explained in an interview published by French daily L’Equipe on Saturday.

“I’m back from the brink,” the former Liverpool and West Ham defender who led Cameroon to back-to-back African Cup of Nations declared.

“My blood pressure was up at like 25 and it felt like my head was exploding,” he said of his stroke, suffered at his home in Yaounde October 3.

“I was lucky to fall on my side and that way when I went down my tongue came out.”

“My dog started barking and the concierge came up but didn’t dare come in. But then a friend showed up and got me help,” he explained.

The 40-year-old was airlifted to France for specialist treatment after suffering a cerebral aneurysm and falling into a coma.

Unmissable on the pitch with his flowing dreadlocks that were dyed blond later in his career, Song also played for Metz and Lens in France and won two league titles at Galatasaray in Turkey.

For Cameroon he played in the same team as the veteran Roger Milla at the 1994 World Cup before the emergence of goal king Samuel Eto’o alongside whom he helped forge Cameroon’s global status.

He was capped 137 times, 36 of them were at CAN finals where he captained his country to the trophy twice in 2000 and 2002 and also won Olympic gold in 2000.

Perhaps the lowest point of his career came at the 2003 Confederations Cup when his friend and central defence partner Marc Vivien Foe died during a game against Colombia from a hereditary heart condition.

Australian man miraculously escapes after holding his head barely above water... for five hours,"Source: 9News

AN AUSTRALIAN MAN has had a lucky escape after a digger he was driving overturned and rolled into a muddy dam.

45-year-old Daniel Miller was trapped after the mechanical tracks of the excavator he was driving shifted unexpectedly forcing both him and the machine into the water.

Miller had been tending to plants on his Charlotte Bay, New South Wales, property when the accident occurred, just after 2.30pm Australian time on Tuesday afternoon.

Subsequently, the roll-bar from the vehicle pinned him beneath the surface of the water as he tried to make his escape.

He remained in that position, with his head barely above the surface of the water, for five hours.

“I didn’t have time to jump clear so I kind of rode the machine down hoping I would be alright. I hit the water and went under. The next thing I feel is the roll bar come across my back, the dam was very soft, very muddy,” he told Australian station 9News.

“I thought I have to get the surface, so I pushed my arms up into the mud and grabbed a mouthful of air.

Source: Facebook

The first thing I thought is ‘I told (my wife) I wouldn’t die first’.

Miller, who is married with young children, said he went “into an almost robotic state and thought ‘just count to 60, move my arms, readjust’”.

Just try and be calm, be logical. Like I watched a cricket climb across a piece of grass for two hours.

I was thinking about how my family is going to find me face down in the dam dead on my property, so that wasn’t going to happen – not without a fight.

Finally, Miller’s cries for help brought a neighbour to his assistance, and emergency services were duly able to dig him out.

He survived, miraculously, with only minor back injuries and a case of hypothermia.

'I can walk a little taller': Radio listeners donate €15k to woman at risk of losing home,"THE DESPERATE STORY of a woman who was at risk of losing her house struck a chord this week with radio listeners, who have offered to help keep her family in their home.

An interview with the woman was broadcast on RTÉ’s Seán O’Rourke show on Monday.

“I’m just hoping and praying that something is going to happen that I can sort something here,” she told reporter Brian O’Connell at Cork Circuit Court, where a number of repossession cases were being heard.

I don’t have any Christmas decorations up, I don’t have any Christmas shopping done. I love Christmas, but I can’t think, you don’t think of anything else when this is going on. It’s in the back of your head the whole time.

Her case had been adjourned until May, but she was in arrears of €28,000 and was paying €500 a month of her €800 bill.

I can feel my whole body crumbling and I’m so tired, so weary all the time.

After hearing her story, over a dozen listeners contacted the show to offer their support. One woman, who wished to remain anonymous offered to pay €10,000 off the balance of the woman’s debt. Several other anonymous donations brought the total to €15,000.

“What amazes me is people’s generosity, but the thing is, going through all of this, you feel so worthless. I actually feel quite bubbly inside at the moment, I feel I’ve got a chance,” the woman told RTÉ after she received the news.

“I feel that I can walk a little talker again. I cannot honestly put into words what I feel at the moment,” she said.

'First definitive evidence' that taking extra Vitamin D can prevent the flu,"TAKING EXTRA VITAMIN D can protect against colds, flu and other respiratory infections, according to a new study which has reopened a debate on the usefulness of over-the-counter supplements.

A review of 25 clinical trials in 14 countries, some with conflicting results, yielded “the first definitive evidence” of a link between vitamin D and flu prevention, researchers claimed in The BMJ medical journal.

The effects were strongest for people with very low levels of the nutrient which is found in some foods and can be synthesised by the body when the skin is exposed to ultraviolet light.

Many people, especially in grey, cloudy climes, do not have enough vitamin D.

Scientific studies over the years have delivered contradictory conclusions on the topic.

Some have shown that low levels of the vitamin increase the risk of bone fractures, heart disease, colorectal cancer, diabetes, depression, Alzheimer’s disease and death.

Others said there is no evidence of a link to disease risk.

New study

For the new study, researchers from the Queen Mary University of London conducted the biggest-ever survey of trials involving nearly 11,000 people.

And they found clues as to why supplements seem to work in some trials but not in others.

“The bottom line is that the protective effects of vitamin D supplementation are strongest in those who have the lowest vitamin D levels, and when supplementation is given daily or weekly rather than in more widely-spaced doses,” lead researcher Adrian Martineau said in a statement.

Vitamin D is thought to protect against respiratory infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia, by boosting levels of antibiotic-like peptides in the lungs, said the team.

This fits with an observation that colds and flu are more common in winter and spring, when vitamin D levels are lowest.

It may also explain why vitamin D seems to protect against asthma attacks, they said.

In an editorial published with the study, experts Mark Bolland and Alison Avenell said it should be viewed as a hypothesis in need of scientific confirmation.

Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, shared their caution.

“This study does not provide sufficient evidence to support recommending vitamin D for reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections,” he said via the Science Media Centre in London.

Other observers were more optimistic.

The case for universal vitamin D supplements, or food fortification, “is now undeniable,” concluded Benjamin Jacobs of the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital.

Thinking of heading the US this summer? There are loads more J-1s going around,"THE US EMBASSY to Ireland has announced that an additional 2,600 J-1 summer work and travel visas will be allocated to Irish students this year.

All students seeking to travel to work in the US this summer will still need to provide evidence of a pre-arranged job across the pond as part of their J-1 applications, a measure which was brought in last year.

The embassy said that the additional allocation would bring Ireland’s number of available J-1 visas to 7,000, which is back in line with 2015 figures.

They are advising all students interested in taking part this year to begin the application process as soon as possible.

Despite intense lobbying from the Irish government in recent years, the US has retained the system of pre-arranged employment as a requirement for J-1 visas.

A statement from the US embassy added that, since its inception over 50 years ago, 150,000 students have embarked to the US on a J-1 programme from Ireland.

Last year saw an issue processing visas for Irish applicants which left dozens unsure if they could travel to the US.

The embassy said it became aware of issues with the processing of applications of dozens of Irish students who had applied for the programme with Travel Bug and their US sponsor American Work Adventures.

At the time, however, the embassy said it would work with all those affected to ensure they could travel to America.

There was better news on the J-1 front in December, with the 12-month visa extended for another three years, concerns were raised following previous comments made by President Donald Trump.

Reacting to the news, Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan said: “he J1 programme is an important and valued part of Ireland’s bilateral relations with the United States.

The Irish Government has been a strong supporter of the programme and, as Minister, I have regularly highlighted its value for young people in Ireland in my bilateral meetings with the US authorities.

“This means you can still watch channels including: Animal Planet, Discovery HD, Discovery History, Discovery Home & Health, Discovery Science, Discovery Shed, Discovery Turbo, DMAX, Eurosport1, Eurosport2, Investigation Discovery, TLC and Quest.”

Stephen van Rooyen, Sky’s UK and ROI CEO, told TheJournal.ie: “We are pleased that we will continue to carry the Discovery and Eurosport channels on Sky.

The deal has been concluded on the right terms after Discovery accepted the proposal we gave them over a week ago. This is a good outcome for all Sky customers.

Discovery was looking for more money, claiming Sky paid it less than a decade ago – despite adding new channels and increasing viewership.

Sky said Discovery “accepted the proposal we gave them over a week ago”, whereas Discovery said they reached a new agreement.

Whoops! We couldn't find this Tweet

Whoops! We couldn't find this Tweet

Discovery thanked viewers in a statement, saying it couldn’t reached an agreement without them.

“Your support over the past few days has been truly amazing and we look forward to bringing you more of the TV you love in the weeks, months and years to come.”

Fans of the channel had taken part in a #KeepDiscovery campaign online, with many threatening to cancel their Sky TV packages if a deal wasn’t reached.

War of words

Prior to last night’s agreement, Discovery had accused Sky of “using what we consider to be its dominant market position to further its own commercial interest over those of viewers and independent broadcasters”.

Sky previously said Discovery’s “price expectations” were “completely unrealistic”.

A statement from the TV provider noted: “We have worked really hard for more than a year to get a deal done for our customers with Discovery, so we are disappointed with their misleading claims and aggressive actions. We now feel it’s time to set the record straight. Because despite our differences, we love Discovery too.

We were prepared to pay a fair price for the Discovery and Eurosport channels and invest more in those channels to make them even better for our customers.

“We have offered hundreds of millions of pounds to Discovery, a $12 billion American business, but that wasn’t enough.

Accenture to create 300 new tech and design jobs in Dublin,"ACCENTURE HAS ANNOUNCED the creation of 300 new jobs as part of plans to “grow and deepen its presence” in Ireland.

The new jobs will be in the field of design and technology, while 100 of these will be located at The Dock, the company’s new research and innovation hub which officially opens today.

The professional services company already employs over 2,200 people in Ireland.

New employees will work across a range of areas including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and in industries ranging from financial services to consumer goods.

The Dock will be based in Dublin’s Grand Canal Dock, and is described as one of the world’s “most connected and intelligent buildings”, as it uses sensors to learn from occupant behaviour, reacts to user feedback and allows the building to continually evolve.

In January last year, the company announced also announced 250 new jobs for Dublin.

There are currently 107 jobs listed under the search term “Dublin” on the company’s website.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny welcomed the news, describing it as a move “which further cements Ireland’s position globally as a technology hub”.

'My Ireland celebrates the underdog who pulled like a dog',"IRELAND IS DESCRIBED as having a sense of community that “isn’t ready to die” in a new video released by the St Patrick’s Festival in preparation for the upcoming celebrations.

Stephen James Smith was commissioned to write the poem My Ireland for the festival, which he also narrated in the video.

According to the St Patrick’s Festival 2017 the theme for this year’s celebrations is ‘Ireland You Are’ and Smith’s poem and video captures the ‘essence of Ireland You Are through, music and video’.

Speaking about what inspired him to write the poem, Smith said: “I found trying to write a country a daunting task, I could feel the weight of history on my shoulders so I was aiming to be as broad as possible.

“In focusing on My Ireland, it instantly became flawed as it’s only a perspective and I don’t have the right to speak for all, but it became more personal and that’s all I or anyone can do. It’s only a start, a prompt for others to say what their Ireland is. Maybe it’s more of a plea than a poem, for us to not resort to some reductive notion of Irishness but instead for us to not forget our common humanity. It’s a calling to listen while at the same time to be heard… so add your voice.”

The video itself was produced by Myles O’Reilly with music produced by Conor O’Brien, of the Villagers, and Colm Mac Con Iomaire, from the Frames, and an original song from Eithne Ní Chatháin called Guí.

The poem reflects on what makes Ireland unique – without ignoring some of the more unsavoury aspects of the country’s history.

My Ireland sees goodness in the kindness of its people everyday which bonds us just enough to get by

My Ireland celebrates the underdog who pulled like a dog. We’re not here to take part we’re here to take over.

My Ireland, you are the Guilford Four, Rossport Five, Birmingham Six, travelling people and forgotten demographics.

Smith describes the poem as ‘a plea’, a calling to move on and to remind ourselves of the humanity of the people of Ireland.

The poem and the accompanying video has been met with praise.

'Inspirational': This Irish documentary is getting great reviews at the Sundance Film Festival,"TWO IRISH DOCUMENTARIES selected for the prestigious Sundance Film Festival have been getting great reviews.

It’s Not Yet Dark, about the filmmaker Simon Fitzmaurice, who has Motor Neuron Disease (ALS), and In Loco Parentis, about the Headfort boarding school, have both been on show at the festival this month.

Sundance, which runs for 10 days in Utah, is an opportunity for Irish filmmakers to get their work seen by critics and film insiders – and a chance for networking and the all-important reviews.

“As the largest independent film festival in the US, the Sundance Film Festival provides an important and powerful platform for both Irish films It’s Not Yet Dark and In Loco Parentis to achieve global recognition,” said James Hickey, Chief Executive Bord Scannan na hEireann/the Irish Film Board.

He noted that Ireland has had a very successful experience at the festival over the years, with films such as Brooklyn, The Guard and Calvary all having had world premieres there.

“The importance of being selected for major festivals such as Sundance cannot be underestimated in terms of ensuring wide international audiences for the films,” he said. “Both films were chosen from thousands of international films and we are very proud of the teams behind each project.”

Of being selected for Sundance, Frankie Fenton – who directed It’s Not Yet Dark – said:

It’s the highest honour to have our film invited to screen at the Sundance Film Festival. We’re all smiling with the news. It means so much to our small team to know that we are bringing Simon and Ruth’s inspirational story to Utah audiences.

The documentary, which is narrated by Colin Farrell, was funded by the IFB and Wellcome Trust in the UK. It looks at how Fitzmaurice himself was premiering his short film The Sound of People at Sundance when he noticed an unusual pain in his foot. He was diagnosed with ALS soon afterwards.

The film explores his journey since, and how he directed his feature film My Name is Emily.

It’s Not Yet Dark has been getting excellent reviews, with IndieWire describing it as “inspirational”, and giving it a grade B-:

Fenton, however understandably, is too drawn to the raw power of Simon’s story to let viewers work their own way through its darkness. On the other hand, it’s the questions that Fenton can’t answer — maybe even the questions he doesn’t mean to ask — that make “It’s Not Yet Dark” such an illuminating experience.

On RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico writes that the film is “incredibly powerful”.

Ultimately, what makes It’s Not Yet Dark so remarkably powerful is the open-book honesty of its subject and those he loves. Ruth is such an honest, well-spoken, interesting woman. Many people will walk out of the film praising Simon, but this is Ruth’s story too. And it’s something relatable for all of us. When Simon says “I dance for the last time,” remembering the moments before he lost control of his muscles, that’s something that connects with the heart.

Over at Screendaily, they praised Fenton for the way she shapes a portrait of Fitzmaurice, and add:

But it’s as much through his words – the film takes material from, and shares a title with, an autobiography written by Fitzmaurice – and the words of his loved ones, that we get to know the man.

In Loco Parentis, directed by Neasa Ní Chianáin, is a documentary about a year in the life of the Headfort boarding school. The Kells school is run by married couple John and Amanda Leyden, who have been in the role for 46 years.

“When we got the call from the Sundance Film Festival programmers, we couldn’t believe it,” said Ní Chianáin. “They said that ‘the world needs a life-affirming film like this at the moment’.”

Indiewire gave the film a Grade B, saying:

In Loco Parentis thrives whenever it regards Headfort as a place suspended between an ancient institution and an overgrown home, one that fosters both the transient children and the adults who have become part of the furniture.

Variety, which calls the school a ‘prep school’, compared the documentary to Nicolas Phillibert’s Etre et Avoir, and said that “it’s hard not to be moved by the dedication and affection that the Headfort staff… put into their work”.

…the filmmaking is delicately executed in every department. Eschewing any visual or graphic gimmicks, Ní Chianáin keeps the look airily naturalistic throughout, lighting and framing Headfort’s rather imposing architecture — which could look darkly austere in a different film — with a consistent emphasis on its breathing room.

The Film Stage said that the film is a “warm work of cinéma vérité”, and “a celebration of the school experience, free of the kind of context that a talking head interview may provide”.

In Loco Parentis has moments of rich beauty as we watch the exact instant where the light bulbs go off for pupils. For those not without background knowledge on the institutions it studies and the alternative it offers to traditional schooling, the film could benefit from a little added context, even if it would sacrifice the its adherence to the traditions of its cinéma vérité approach.

Opinion: 'Rural Ireland is not dead. It’s on the verge of great things.',"IRELAND NEEDS ‘RURAL Ireland’. There’s no getting around it. We need its people, its energy, its resources, its space and its creativity. Ushering in its demise is misguided.

Rural Ireland in the future could be a net exporter of energy, water, services, global technology products and ideas. It can become an economic powerhouse in its own right.

We need to stop analysing our issues in isolation – rural broadband, rural transport, rural jobs – we all live in one country where our families are dispersed across urban and rural communities.

Progress for some is about growth and development. For me it’s about resilience and sustainability. Rural Ireland is testament to both of these things.

The label ‘Rural Ireland’

To some it’s a byword for depressing economic decay, a compartment of the mind that conjures the ghosts of emigration, unemployment and the loss of hope.

But, despite the impression you may get from media reporting of cutbacks to services and transport, lack of broadband penetration and a flight to the cities, my vision for Rural Ireland is somewhat brighter, more optimistic and entirely achievable.

As a region, Rural Ireland is changing. It has responded to international trends and is surviving by embracing the shifts in global technology. In fact, people of rural Ireland are the leaders of this global technology change.

How can we improve the countryside?

Rural Ireland wants to be the one of the best places to live and work in continental Europe. It is perfectly positioned to lead development if we connect our strengths as a low carbon, green and natural economy.

Like many others, I believe in Rural Ireland. I understand its capacity and it is latent. It’s not hidden — it just hasn’t been unlocked.

I spoke recently to a counterpart in Norway who deals with equally peripheral issues as we do in the west and northwest of Ireland. In the late 1990s and 2000s they too witnessed an increasing trend towards urban areas.

This now has reversed with their adoption of gigabit fibre to rural homes and villages. This investment has seen a stabilisation of population, growth in employment and increasing demand for property and housing.

His final comment resonated with me: “We were so far behind that we ended up in front.” Norway’s western region had a blank canvas to craft a vision which it then executed. It is now time to craft our own vision.

Adopt Norway’s strategy to make our countryside smart

The same principles must be adopted now to make our rural areas smart. The language of urban versus rural needs to stop and we need to grow together. Too often in Ireland the media has been of an urban centric view of growth. But are they right?

Yes, figures show rural depopulation, disparity between rural and urban unemployment levels while rural areas contribute significantly less. But does that mean we should we maintain this slide? I think the answer is no and I think a turning point is coming.

International trends and statistics illustrate the movement to urban and city living. But what kind of cities are we creating?

In many urban centres, it is difficult to afford rents, even for the smallest apartments. It is impossible for many to own a family home. For many people, quality of life is poor. They dream of something else, something affordable and more fulfilling.

We are a nation with international recognition for our innovation, and problem solving. These traits are steeped in our rural and agricultural background. One only has to look at our agri-technology sector to see our global impression.

All this means Rural Ireland is at a distinct advantage. Due to our historical and dispersed settlement patterns, our rural communities are relatively well serviced.

There are great schools, affordable housing and an unbeatable, clean environment. Source: Shutterstock/Federica Violin

Yes, there is poor broadband and mobile connectivity, and patchy transport services that further exacerbate the distance between rural communities and markets. But there are great schools, affordable housing and an unbeatable, clean environment.

Steps are underway that will fix a lot of problems and obstacles in this area. We have initiatives such as SIRO providing 100% fibre broadband to rural towns such as Sligo, Castlebar and Letterkenny.

The government has committed to the National Broadband Plan to deliver 30mbps to every rural household. Electrification was not without its delays; we will get there but we need to be ready for its delivery.

Rural Ireland 2.0 is possible

I look around rural economies and I see our companies and businesses moving online, trading internationally and growing their business globally. We have tech development companies trading from Gaeltacht islands.

I want to be part of a future that celebrates urban life. I want our economy to welcome Google and Apple and other industry giants. But I also want to see their workers and the self-employed living next door to me in a vibrant Rural Ireland 2.0.

The time to show we were smart enough to shape that future, when we had the chance, is now.

The forgotten story of Irish-Australians after the 1916 Rising is getting an international audience,"A DOCUMENTARY WHICH delves into the story of how the 1916 Rising affected Australia has been picked up a national broadcaster in the country and will be made available across Etihad Airways’ international fleet.

‘Michael, they’ve shot them’ tells the story of how the events of the Easter Rising inspired the Irish Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, Corkman Daniel Mannix, to take a very public stance against the conscription that Australians faced.

The strong Irish heritage at the time in Australia also inspired thousands to support the cause for Irish independence in the country, and the story is explored in this film from Flight of the Cubs Productions.

Its director, Eoin Hahessy, told TheJournal.ie that the documentary helped to tell “an untold story” that helped to forge a really strong Irish Catholic force in Australia.

“In some ways, a lot of Irish Australian history has been forgotten,” he said. “This was one of the bitterest chapters in Australian history.”

When the news reached the country that the leaders of the Easter Rising had been executed, Archbishop Mannix waded strongly into Australian politics where the British had traditionally dominated the pillars of power.

He reportedly wept “Michael, they have shot them” to his caretaker in Melbourne when the news reached him.

“He put it to the British establishment,” Hahessy explained. “He became a hero in the fight against conscription. The Australian government tried to introduce it in World War One.”

This fight from a Catholic bishop meant that disagreements then fell upon sectarian lines, a conflict which Hahessy describes as “bitter”.

“Irish Catholics were seen as disloyal, but plenty of them joined up to fight for the British in the war,” Hahessy said.

Mannix mobilised sentiment to such an extent that conscription was twice defeated in Australian parliament, leading the Prime Minister to send a cable to his British counterpart David Lloyd George to say that the Irish “killed conscription”.

The Irish-Melbourne community’s solidarity with the Irish campaign for independence culminated in a St Patrick’s Day march in the city in 1920, which saw over 100,000 people lined the streets of the city.

Archbishop Mannix’s work helped to lay foundations for the modern Australian Labour Party, who are currently leading the opposition in the country’s parliament.

The documentary on this “forgotten” bit of history about Australia, and that of the 1916 Rising, will be broadcast this St Patrick’s weekend on national broadcaster SBS, and Hahessy is hoping for a similar reaction to the film, after it received a positive reception following an RTÉ broadcast.

The film will also be rolled out on Etihad Airways fleet of international flights from February.

“There’s not a parish back home that hasn’t seen a son or daughter come to Australia,” the director added. “We’ve gotten generally good feedback here from the Irish community so far. They’re all very social media savvy so the word has gotten round very well.

“There’s a really young Irish community here and, after this film, we’re now looking at new ways to tell the other forgotten stories from Irish-Australian history and bring them to the fore.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/1916-documentary-international-3203801-Jan2017/,the_journal,1
"Carlow teen thanks public after raising €600,000 for cancer treatment following emotional video","CARLOW TEENAGER SHAUNTELLE Tynan has managed to raise €600,000 following an emotional video posted on her Facebook page on Sunday.

The 18-year-old needs to travel to Houston, Texas to receive specialised cancer treatment that is not available anywhere else.

In the video, Tynan pleaded with the public to support her health care costs in the US and said specialist treatment would be her “last-chance”.

Since posting the video, the funds have gone from €50,000 on Sunday to almost €650,000 as it stands this evening.

Shauntelle took to social media to thank everybody who donated:

The people of Ireland have truly come together to help me get better and for that I’m truly thankful. There has been few haters but millions of lovers and each person showing positivity helps us through each day. The good always outshines the bad.

“I now have a true chance of beating this. I will never be able to express how thankful I am.

On this Valentine’s Day, I didn’t just receive a teddy or a card, but the chance of life.

Speaking to the Ray D’Arcy Show on RTÉ Radio 1 today Shauntelle explained how she made the video upstairs in her bedroom while her Mam made dinner downstairs.

We hadn’t had a donation in five days and I thought I’d make a video, I didn’t think it would go viral.

“We thought that the gofundme page had got a virus or something was wrong as it was going up by thousands, we couldn’t take our eyes off it.”

Shauntelle’s mother’s Leona said their doctor in America described Shauntelle’s case as the ‘most complex case he had seen in his career.’

"GIY Guru: 'I’ve become interested in mindfulness, sitting quietly for ten minutes, in the morning'","AND SO IT begins again. Another year of seed sowing. I did my first sowing of the year yesterday afternoon in the potting shed, and as always was completely and utterly in my element.

There’s a lot of talk of late about mindfulness and the need for us all to train our minds to slow down the chatter. Over the last few years I’ve become interested in mindfulness meditation, sitting quietly for ten minutes, usually first thing in the morning.

I’ve discovered that you tend to notice the benefits elsewhere in the day rather than during the ten minutes on the cushion. There are simply more moments during the day where you are fully present, noticing a sight or sound or sensation or smell, rather than being permanently distracted by the incessant stream of thoughts in your head.

Some activities lend themselves particularly well to mindfulness

You also notice that some activities lend themselves particularly well to mindfulness. You might have to remind yourself to focus on brushing your teeth for example, for it is a task that becomes so routine and so boring, that you rarely pay much attention to it.

But seed sowing for me is an activity that automatically silences the mind, and brings me back to present moment awareness. I guess it’s because it’s such an intricate process, trying to coax the life out of tiny little seeds.

Anyway, it’s not surprising that the time I spend sowing seeds in the potting shed, is generally when I am at my most content (and honestly, “content” is not a word that anyone would generally use to describe me). Seed sowing is my happy place.

The sowing year

I always find it ironic that the sowing year kicks off in what still feels like the depths of winter with three of the quintessential Mediterranean crops: tomatoes, aubergines and peppers (chilli and sweet). But all three of these vegetables need a long growing season in our climate and so they benefit from a February sowing.

You have the option of waiting another few months and buying the seedlings for these vegetables from a garden centre, but if you want to sow from seed then now’s the time to get cracking.

It’s way too cold for them to germinate in our miserable February weather (they will need a temperature of between 21 and 27 degrees Celsius) and so you need to provide them with artificial heat. This can be done either by keeping them indoors on a sunny windowsill in the house, or if outside in a greenhouse, polytunnel or potting shed you will need a heated mat. These are relatively inexpensive to buy.

My little bit of Spain

I sow tomatoes, aubergines and peppers in module trays (one seed to each module) and then place the trays themselves on the heated mat. The mat that I have is about 2m long and can be set to a specific temperature. It also has a sensor so if things warm up in the potting shed during the day, then it will switch itself off automatically.

Just to be sure, I also cover the module trays with fleece which should make a bitterly cold Dunmore East feel a little more like the south of Spain. It will be a couple of months before the seedlings are moved on from the module trays into their own pots, and longer again before they’re planted in the ground.

Crucially, I will have to wait until July to eat the first tomatoes. But at least we’ve started.

The Basics – The Needs of Seeds

You will probably remember from your science classes back in school, that seeds need some specific conditions in order to germinate and thrive. Most seeds need these three conditions:

Heat. Generally speaking most seeds need a decent temperature to germinate. A warm windowsill in the house or a heated bench in the potting shed is therefore ideal for starting seeds off. There are exceptions, but it’s a good rule of thumb. Light. Once germination begins, light is essential. This explains why seeds sown too early in the year often get “leggy” and weak. They are literally straining to reach the light because there is not enough daylight. Some veg like celery and lettuce need light in order to germinate in the first place. Most seeds need 14 hours or so of light in order to thrive. Some growers even use artificial lighting to compensate for the lack of natural light early in the year. I prefer to work with the seasons a little more. Humidity/ moisture. The key when it comes to watering seeds is that they need uniform moisture. Not water-logged, and certainly never allowed to dry out. Gentle watering with a fine rose is essential to ensure you don’t wash the seeds away (or push them too deep into the soil to germinate).

Spring has sprung (just about) and this month at GROW HQ we’ve a range of courses, classes and events to kick off the growing season. We’ve also a range of cookery courses, and special seasonal eating events including a silent mindful lunch and our monthly Friday Feast. For more check out www.growhq.org.

Parsnips, as you know, are tough as old boots and I still have a decent batch in the ground outside in the veg patch. Here’s a great recipe for tarting them up a bit from Donal Skehan from the GIY cookbook GROW COOK EAT.

Ingredients

1kg of parsnips

3 tablespoons of wholemeal flour

1 tablespoon of ground black pepper

1 tablespoon of sea salt

1 generous handful of Parmesan cheese

2 tablespoons of olive oil

Directions

Preheat the oven to 200oC/390oF/Gas 6. Peel the parsnips, chop them in half and then slice them into four pieces. You may need to slice the chunks in half again depending on what size you want them.

Place the parsnips in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring the pot to the boil and simmer for 4 minutes. Rinse with a little cold water and drain the chunks in a colander.

Combine the flour, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Tumble the parsnips into the bowl and toss to coat. Place in a large roasting tray, sprinkle over the Parmesan cheese and drizzle with olive oil.

Roast in the oven for 25 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.

Off-duty soldier rescues 1-year-old nephew after he fell into the freezing River Barrow,"Michael Lyons rescued Max, who'd fallen into the River Barrow in Carlow Town Source: Michael Lyons

A FAMILY IN Carlow managed to narrowly avert tragedy last week after a young toddler fell into the freezing water of the River Barrow.

Michael Lyons was on a family outing with his two children, his father and their 18-month-old nephew Max last week when the incident occurred.

The off-duty soldier’s 18-month-old nephew was feeding the ducks at Carlow rowing club when he fell over the low railing into the freezing water of the River Barrow at around 12.15pm on Sunday.

Michael immediately jumped in to save Max, and managed to get him out before the boy suffered any serious injuries.

“It still doesn’t feel real,” Michael Lyons told TheJournal.ie.

Instinct took over, and all I could think was that I had to make this right.

Max’s mother, and Michael’s sister Aisling, had been in Galway for the weekend, and he had proposed taking Max out with his two children – aged two and five – for the day.

His father, also called Michael, came along too, while Max’s father said he’d meet them later.

They decided to feed the ducks on the Quay by Carlow rowing club.

“It all happened so quickly,” Michael said. “Max was feeding ducks and next thing he’d tripped over the railings and fell about 8 foot into the freezing water.”

Michael shared a glance with his father, before jumping in himself.

This picture will live with me for the rest of my life. As I was jumping in, I could see him under the water with his eyes open. I just had to get him. He was definitely coming back with me.

Although he is a soldier, Michael said it wasn’t a matter of his training kicking in, he just did what he felt he had to.

“It had nothing to do with being a soldier,” he said. “Family came into it first, before work did.

All I could think of his father saying goodbye to him that morning, and the last picture we took of all the lads together just a few minutes before.

He managed to get a hold of Max and raise him above the water. However, there was still a major problem as he had to lift him to such a height above the water so his father could grab a hold of the boy.

By the time I had him up, it was another 3 feet I needed to lift him. I had my clothes on too, so by the time he was up, I was starting to go down.

“I had to get underneath him and swim with one hand, and the water was so cold,” Michael said.

It was then that Michael’s eldest son started to call for help, just as he managed to get Max out of the water.

A man from a nearby apartment block came down to them with towels and blankets, while his wife heated their apartment upstairs so they could warm Max up.

“By the time Max’s father arrived, all I could say was, ‘Sorry’,” Michael said.

Max was taken to a doctor later that day and got the all-clear, and Michael paid the family a visit later that evening.

His sister had arrived back, and everyone was grateful and relieved that Michael had acted so quickly to rescue his nephew.

Michael, however, says he is still feeling the shock from the event.

“The thought of what could have happened if Max had panicked is horrible,” he explained. “He could have easily swallowed a load of water but did not. It could have different. One of mine could have fallen in.

If anything had happened to any of them, I couldn’t live with myself. I’d be forever blaming myself.

Luckily, both he and Max have made a full recovery from the incident.

Michael’s father told TheJournal.ie that he was immensly proud of his son for taking such swift action.

Regan tweeted yesterday that the kidney donation operation had been a success and that both men were recovering well.

“Operation was a huge success on both sides,” Regan tweeted.

Head spinning – We did it! In shock right now.

Little US etiquette question. Do you tip a surgeon? Operation was a huge success on both sides. Head spinning-We did it! In shock right now. — Jarlath Regan (@Jarlath) February 2, 2017 Source: Jarlath Regan /Twitter

Regan – who hosts the An Irishman Abroad podcast – announced last year that he would be donating his kidney to his brother.

Speaking to Eoghan McDermott on 2FM in August, said that he didn’t hesitate when his brother asked him.

“Of course I’m going to save my brother’s life,” he said at that time.

Let’s be honest, too – it’s the ultimate good guy thing to do.

From this point on, nobody can call me selfish. I have medical evidence that I am a decent human being.

Regan said that there had been debate over the donation, but the decision was a straightforward one.

“I have two sisters…I have a kid and a wife. I have to support them.

Families fall out over organ donation all the time. But the mad thing is there are people walking around with two kidneys when you only need one.

Regan said that his brother would probably have died within five years without the operation, but with it has “another 25 or 30 added to that”.",https://www.thejournal.ie/jarlath-regan-kidney-3223046-Feb2017/,the_journal,1
Irish mathematicians working hard to make the perfect cup of coffee,"IT IS THE question that every caffeine addict has pondered.

Now, perfectly timed to coincide with the mid-afternoon slump, mathematicians at University of Limerick (UL) have announced that they are now a step closer to the perfect cup of coffee.

Rather than focusing on the mundane, the researchers aim to answer one of “life’s most pressing questions” through their work published today in the SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics.

They used advanced mathematical analysis of what they describe as a “hideously complicated” set of variables, to find the right blend.

According to the team led by Kevin Moroney at UL, coffee brewing is poorly understood and getting it to taste just right is as complex as making the perfect wine.

Their conclusion is that the size of the coffee grain is crucial for the perfect cup, but a long list of other factors must be considered.

Lead author Kevin Moroney of University of Limerick, left, and Dr William Lee measuring coffee concentration using a refractometer

Dr William Lee explains: “What makes the best coffee is hideously complicated – from the shape of the filter, to the scale of a single grain to the flow rate of water and which machine or tool is used, there are an enormous amount of variables.

By using mathematical analysis, we can begin to tell the story of which elements and in what order lead to the best coffee. We are now one step closer to the perfect cup of coffee.

The research team hopes to use their methods to develop a complete theory of coffee brewing, and use it to inform the design of filter coffee machines in the same way that industry uses the theory of fluid and solid mechanics to design aeroplanes and racing cars.

According to the Irish Coffee Council, we consume almost 4,000 tonnes of coffee here each year, while statistics from Euromonitor International show that just under €100 million was spent on coffee by Irish consumers last year.",https://www.thejournal.ie/perfect-cup-coffee-3082777-Nov2016/,the_journal,1
You'll soon be able to access your Netflix account from every country in the EU,"EUROPEANS TRAVELLING WITHIN the 28 EU member states will no longer be cut off from online services they have paid for back home, such as films, sporting broadcasts, music, e-books or games.

MEP Brian Hayes said that an agreement has been reached this week between the European Parliament and Malta, which acts on behalf of all EU States in its role as the bloc’s current holder of the rotating presidency.

The new measures will apply only to online fee-based services. Free services will be exempt and it will remain up to the provider to decide if they will be made available across the EU.

Previously, streaming services such as Netflix were blocked when you attempted to access them from a different country.

Hayes said: “This agreement is a first step towards modernising copyright rules in the EU, and comes after the abolition of roaming charges for mobile phones came into effect last year.

“While this agreement still must be formally approved, this is another step towards breaking down barriers in the single market of 500 million people and good news for people travelling to other EU countries on business, holidays, or to study.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/netflix-eu-europe-watch-3235766-Feb2017/,the_journal,1

Work on The Liberties' new park will begin in the coming weeks,"Source: Dublin City Council

THE LIBERTIES, DUBLIN is getting a public park.

After the idea was first suggested in 2013, activist group Cork Street Park were notified this week that a team to build the park had been chosen and would arrive at the site to officially begin work on a park for the area in the coming weeks.

The project is the first major project to be developed as part of the Liberties Greening Strategy, and also the first purpose-built public park for the Liberties community.

The plans include a pathway, benches, a playground, a terrace, skateboarding facilities, and spaces to add things in at a later stage.

Source: Dublin City Council

Skate D8

The interest in Cork Street Park was sparked by skateboarding group Skate D8, who had campaigned to turn the derelict park into a place they could use.

It’s often difficult for skateboarders to find somewhere to practice: they can be moved on from areas that aren’t specially designated for skateboarders, while public benches and walls can sometimes be fitted with metal balls and strips to stop people from skating on them.

In October 2013, the city manager stopped the park from being levelled and began a process of consultation about how the space could be used.

In workshop groups with the local community, green space, community space, and a playground made up more than half of most participants’ priorities for the park.

These were added to skatepark facilities to create a park for community events and other activities.

Dublin City Council

At the centre of the park will be a large lawn for games and activities and smaller raised lawn for sitting and reclining. On the edges of this central area will be a terrace onto Cork Street, an enclosed play area, a picnic space, and a small exercise space.

There will also be a playground for children aged under 10 years old. The large play unit will have a series of levels with raised platforms accessible by ropes and steps and a lower level accessible to children with physical disabilities.

The terrace will provide a “hang-out space” for teenagers and a place for skateboarders to display their skills. While the Park design does not incorporate a café kiosk, the terrace is designed to accommodate one in the future.

The design of the pergola (a square timber structure with a flat roof and no walls) can also incorporate games such as a chess board on the ground and table tennis, if required.

Although there won’t be a specifically allocated area within the park for skating, the edges between the path and grass will be designed as a raised sculptural feature to accommodate activities such as skating, BMX, parkour, play and seating.

A nod to…

The pergola inclusion is inspired by the timber frames of the Tenters Field which was located nearby. The Tenters Field was where local textiles makers brought cloth to be stretched and dried.

The playground unit will incorporate mock building facades onto Chamber St to resemble the Dutch Billy gable fronted houses that once lined the street.

The play equipment is designed to make reference to the historical heritage of the area as being central to Dublin’s cloth working and leather tanning industry. This provides the opportunity to communicate this aspect of the local heritage to the children using the play area.

In a statement to TheJournal.ie, Dublin City Council said that the park was “a step forward in addressing the deficit of quality green space and outdoor recreation opportunities in this part of the city”.

It is one of a series of greening projects that the city council plans to undertake over the next few years to support the Liberties in being a great place to live and work.

The park is expected to be completed by this summer.

Ireland's €88m Euromillions jackpot will be shared by syndicate,"Update: It has since emerged that the syndicate was in fact based in Dublin and we have updated our article to reflect this.

IRELAND’S NEWEST EUROMILLIONS winning ticket was bought by a work syndicate in Dublin.

The National Lottery confirmed that the winners had been in touch but, at the time, did not provide any further details about where the ticket was sold.

The winning syndicate was the only winner of the mammoth jackpot and it represents the third Irish Euromillions win in the past year.

Speaking this afternoon on The Ray D’Arcy Show on RTÉ One, National Lottery CEO Dermot Griffin said they’ve heard from the winner but explained that they may have to wait until next week to receive the funds.

“They have been in touch to make arrangements to collect the money,” Griffin said.

Because it is such a large amount, the amounts have to be collected from each of the other countries, there’s eight other countries in Euromillions. That has to go through the banking system, so the funds will be available next week.

This jackpot win is the tenth ever for Ireland since the Euromillions began in 2004 and is the third largest ever win ever in Ireland.

Adele on her Grammy wins: 'My idol is Queen Bey and I adore you',"ADELE TRIUMPHED ONCE again at the Grammys last night bagging five awards for her latest blockbuster album, paying glowing tribute to her rival Beyonce, calling her an idol.

The English balladeer swept up the top prizes of the night at the music industry’s biggest night – Album, Record and Song of the Year. Beyonce walked away with two trophies.

And in a sentimental homage to late rock icon David Bowie, his final album Blackstar earned five awards, including four posthumous prizes for the singer.

Adele, who has stood by her winning style of heart-wrenching ballads, became the first act ever to sweep the three key categories in two different years.

She won Record of the Year, which recognises overall song, and Song of the Year, which looks at songwriting, for her ubiquitous hit Hello and Album of the Year for 25.

Adele made a similar sweep in 2012 with her last album 21 – which remains the only album to have outsold 25 in the past decade.

Fighting back tears, Adele took the podium and paid tribute to Beyonce, who had led the night’s nominations with nine for her politically edgy Lemonade.

“My idol is Queen Bey and I adore you. You move my soul every day,” Adele said as she looked at Beyonce, who was making her first public appearance since announcing she was pregnant with twins.

It was a happy ending to a night which began with Adele – using an expletive that was cut from the television broadcast – insisted on starting over her tribute to late pop icon George Michael.

- Beyonce’s call for inclusive world -

Beyonce won for Best Urban Contemporary Album for Lemonade and Best Music Video for Formation.

The video marked the most political statement of Beyonce’s career as she rallied behind the Black Lives Matter movement with imagery of police officers surrendering as if under arrest.

Reflecting her increasingly experimental side, Beyonce’s Grammy performance was a New Age-inspired celebration of motherhood.

She showed her exposed belly underneath a bra on a projection on stage – before the real-life 35-year-old singer took the stage with a golden crown and cape.

With hints of India and ancient Egypt, Beyonce sang two new songs as dozens of female dancers surrounded her with flowers and a spoken word incantation lauded the power of women.

Accepting one of her awards, Beyonce said Lemonade and the accompanying film were meant “to create a body of work that will give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history — to confront issues that make us uncomfortable”.

“It’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror – first through their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House and the Grammys – and see themselves,” Beyonce said, in one of the night’s more subtle political comments.

The evening saw its most forceful statement as rapper Busta Rhymes took the stage with hip-hop pioneers A Tribe Called Quest and emerging artist Anderson .Paak.

Denouncing US President Donald Trump for his efforts to curtail immigration, Busta Rhymes mocked President Agent Orange and shouted, “We come together! We the people!” as performers knocked through a wall.

Paris Jackson, the 18-year-old daughter of King of Pop Michael Jackson, voiced hope when she saw the enthusiastic crowd in the Staples Center in Los Angeles – the scene eight years earlier of her father’s memorial service.

“We can really use this kind of excitement at a pipeline protest, guys,” she said to cheers.

- Posthumous honours for Bowie -

Blackstar – the final album of Bowie – won in all five categories for which it was nominated, including Best Rock Song and Best Alternative Music Album.

Bowie had won only one Grammy in his lifetime before Sunday.

And Blackstar, which he released two days before his death last year from an undisclosed battle with cancer, was controversially passed over for Album of the Year honours.

Bowie showed himself innovative to the end by collaborating with the avant-garde jazz saxophonist Donny McCaslin.

While not predicting how Bowie would have felt, McCaslin told reporters:

When the press was hearing the album before it came out, I could see it meant a lot to him.

Chance the Rapper, 23, picked up three prizes including the closely watched Best New Artist award for his gospel-infused hip-hop. The Chicago artist benefited from updated rules that now consider streaming exclusives.

Bruno Mars electrified the crowd with a tribute to Prince, uncannily channeling the late pop icon by donning a purple jacket and playing a guitar solo to Let’s Go Crazy.

The performance marked a new commercial effort by the estate of Prince – who famously rejected music industry conventions – with his classic albums on Sunday returning to major streaming sites.

'A great day for Ireland': Irish sign language one step closer to official recognition,"Updated: 18: 55

A SENATOR HAS told of his delight as the Irish Sign Language Bill moved one step closer to becoming law.

Fianna Fáil’s Mark Daly said today was a “great day” for the the deaf community in Ireland as the passage of this bill would be hugely beneficial for everyone in the country.

Under the bill, Irish Sign Language (ISL) would be designated as a native and independent language that is used as the primary means of communication by over 5,000 members of the deaf community.

Daly said: “The cross-party support that my bill received today is testament to the hard work of the Irish deaf community in raising awareness of their needs, and shining a spotlight on the challenges they face on a day to day basis.

The impact of this piece of legislation would be truly transformative for the deaf community enabling ISL to be used in legal proceedings and would require Irish TV broadcasters to have subtitling on a greater proportion of broadcasts.

“From interaction with social protection services to buying a TV license or dealing with your local authority, the Irish deaf community have been denied equal rights and opportunities for years.

“When this bill is passed, it will also require the State to provide interpreting services for students who use Irish Sign Language, and would require every public body to devise and implement an action plan to promote the use of sign language within the organisation.”

Minister of State with special responsibility for disabilities, Finian McGrath said the sponsors of the bill have done a “very valuable public service”.

He said: “I am happy that the bill will now move on to complete the pre-legislative scrutiny process and then, in due course and, in light of the assessment by the Oireachtas of the bill’s proposals, that we can work together to see what amendments are needed to create the focussed right to interpretation I am thinking of.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-sign-language-law-bill-3035112-Oct2016/,the_journal,1

The campaign seeks to promote the events that 'happen in between' the important stuff, as part of a new Visit Dublin campaign.

FÁILTE IRELAND’S NEW campaign to attract British visitors to Dublin during the low season period will be launched tomorrow – and its tagline has left us with a few questions.

‘Dublin is what happens in between’ is the new mantra of the tourism push aimed at our closest neighbours, and we’re not quite sure what that means (Dublin is what happens between north America and continental Europe, perhaps?)

In its press release, Fáilte Ireland said that the campaign “seeks to promote the unexpected variety of experiences on offer to those who visit Dublin”.

Building on the visitor experience of Dublin, where even a simple plan can develop an unexpected dimension and interesting things happen in between, the seeks to draw on makes Dublin unique – explicitly stating that what makes visiting here so memorable, is what happens in between.

So what we think they’re getting at is that the most unique part of Dublin is the unexpected occurrences that happen in between the main events.

In this week’s budget, it was announced that a reduced rate of VAT at just 9% would be retained by the industry to protect them against any hit that Brexit might have on the country’s tourism industry.

Chairman of the Grow Dublin Advisory Board Michael Carey said that although Dublin’s tourism had a “really good year”, they had to look further ahead and at the effect Brexit might have.

Noel John McLoughlin, director of marketing with Fáilte Ireland, agreed:

“While Brexit poses a challenge for Irish tourism in the British market, it also challenges our European competitors who seek to target that market also. By targeting those segments with the most potential, we hope to gain a competitive edge and win additional British business for Dublin during that quieter part of the year.”

Could these 9 ideas change Ireland for the better?,"“DO YOU HAVE the next big idea to change Ireland?”

This was the question we asked people across Ireland earlier this year. Hundreds of people replied, from every corner of the country. The ideas that came back were incredible.

We often think that we have to wait for the system to change things. But there are people all over the country who have innovative ideas to solve Ireland’s social problems and they have the drive and determination to put these ideas into action.

These people are entrepreneurs. But not in the traditional sense. Instead of having an idea to make a profit, they have an idea to create a social change, to make life better for people and to create a better society.

At Social Entrepreneurs Ireland we select the best entrepreneurs with the best ideas and give them funding and support to make that idea a reality.

Some of the previous Social Entrepreneurs Ireland winners have been FoodCloud – an app developed by Aoibheann O’Brien and Iseult Ward which matches retailers who have too much food with charities that have too little; and the Irish Men’s Sheds Association founded by John Evoy which has had a huge impact in combating isolation and suicide among men in Ireland.

Like Dragon’s Den, we filter through the applications, interview the entrepreneurs and finally, after a thorough and in-depth selection process we have found the top nine ideas to change Ireland for 2016 and the entrepreneurs behind them.

And they are…

A Lust for Life – Niall Breslin and Susan Quirke

Sometimes an idea arrives at just the right time, when people need it most and when a country is really ready to embrace it. For Ireland, this idea is A Lust for Life. There are hundreds of thousands of people across the country who are experiencing or have experienced a mental health issue. This can be very lonely. It can also be daunting and overwhelming.

Source: Leah Farrell/RollingNews.ie

A Lust for Life aims to bring people together, to show solidarity in doing activities together, like a run or a cycle. They are creating strong communities so no one has to feel alone, no matter what they are going through.

A Lust for Life has also created a platform where experts can give advice and people can talk about the mental health issues they are experiencing. A Lust for Life is a national wellbeing movement utilising a holistic approach to promote positive mental health, suicide prevention and physical health. Through the media and grassroots advocacy A Lust for Life aims to change the way we talk about and treat mental health issues in Ireland.

Lakers- Meeting Special Needs – Claire Brady

Lakers is changing people’s lives in a big way. It is an idea that is set to take off across the country. The idea behind Lakers is to create a place where people of all age groups with different intellectual disabilities can participate in a wide range of sporting, social, recreational, and developmental activities.

Lakers asks its members what activities they would like to take part in and facilitates the various interests of its members. Lakers also provides a strong, supportive network for parents and families of its members. If you have an intellectual disability in Ireland sometimes the choice of activities that you can take part in can be very limited.

This has a huge effect on the quality of life for people with intellectual disabilities and their families. Lakers is changing people’s lives by giving them diversity and choice and creating an environment where people can thrive and reach their full potential.

ReCreate – Dara Connolly

Many businesses have surplus materials at the end of the day, which are often sent to landfill. Meanwhile, many communities around Ireland cannot afford art materials, which can be very expensive. ReCreate is a fantastic idea which bridges this gap. ReCreate salvages materials from businesses, like Avoca handweavers or Bewleys and makes art materials out of them.

They have created a Warehouse of Wonders which is full of incredible materials. They hold workshops and invite groups and schools from disadvantaged communities to join in the workshops or avail of art supplies. ReCreate’s mission is to be an inclusive social enterprise by inspiring curiosity, creativity and care for the environment by supporting businesses nationwide to divert materials from landfill. This is a very special project and a trip to the Warehouse of Wonders is a must for children and adults alike.

Buddy Bench Ireland – Sam Synnott and Judith Ashton

Buddy Bench Ireland is a simple but wonderful idea – to put a colourful bench in school yards around Ireland. The aim is to encourage children to use the bench to talk to each other about their feelings.

This is coupled with a programme they have developed, which aims to teach children how to express their emotions and talk about how they are feeling. This has mental health benefits and creates a supportive and communicative environment for children from a very young age.

It is surprising how many young children experience anxiety issues and don’t know how to express what they’re going through. Sam and Judith’s vision is to have a buddy bench in every school in the country. This could make all the difference to the mental health of the next generation.

CyberSafeIreland – Alex Cooney and Cliona Curley

One third of internet users are children. This may surprise you. What may surprise you even more is what these children are doing online. Many parents worry about children being on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. But what they may not realise is that there are a whole host of other apps and websites that children are accessing that parents don’t even know exist.

One in five children has come into contact with a stranger online and many of the dangers of the internet like cyberbullying and grooming are very real concerns when children are growing up with the internet as part of their daily lives. And yet, there’s no national strategy to help parents and teachers to deal with this issue.

CyberSafeIreland works with children, talking to them about the apps and websites they are using. They then advise parents, teachers and children about how kids can be stronger, smarter and safer online. This idea is timely and will help our society to adapt to a fast-changing world.

DabbledooMusic – Shane McKenna and Killian Redmond

Many primary school teachers don’t know how to read music, and yet they are supposed to teach it in the classroom. Remember this?

Source: w3asel

This can be daunting and often means that teachers avoid teaching the subject as they’re not confident about it themselves. The reality is, because of this, a lot of children around the country are missing out on music education and the joy and skills that come with it. DabbledooMusic has the solution.

By creating a programme that uses colours in place of musical notation, they are making teaching and learning music more accessible, engaging, and fun for teachers and students. If you’ve never played music in your life, you’ll be playing a polka in a matter of minutes! Check it out.

Mobility Mojo – Noelle Daly and Stephen Cluskey

For many people with mobility issues- whether they are in wheelchairs, are elderly, or pushing a pram or buggy, accessibility is a major issue. And yet, it can be incredibly difficult to find any reliable information about whether hotels, bars, restaurants or tourist sites are accessible.

This makes life very difficult for more than 600,000 people affected by reduced mobility in Ireland and their friends and families too. Mobility Mojo is an exciting new app which aims to solve this.

It’s like ‘TripAdvisor’ for those with mobility issues. Developed by Noelle and Stephen, who are both wheelchair users themselves, it is a platform for people to give live reviews on transport routes, public buildings, tourist attractions and accommodation.

Their mission is to create a barrier-free travel environment for people with limited mobility and make Ireland the most accessible destination. It’s one of those ideas you just can’t believe doesn’t exist already.

Problem Gambling Ireland – Barry Grant

With the tap of a phone these days you can lose your paycheck, your rent money, your relationships, your job. This is because gambling is so easy to do on your mobile phone. For people who are addicted to gambling this is a major problem.

Barry is an addiction counsellor and witnessed first-hand the devastating effects of problem gambling – from mental health issues to family breakdown to crime committed to support addiction.

Problem Gambling Ireland is an independent resource dedicated to reducing gambling related harm through preventative education, awareness-raising of gambling addiction and lobbying for statutory regulation of the gambling industry.

Its mission is to provide an independent suite of supports, resources and referral pathways for problem gamblers and their families. This idea is tackling a complicated issue in a real and meaningful way.

Step Out Ireland – Francis Cleary

One in eight people in Ireland suffer from social anxiety disorder. That means probably one of your friends or family may go through this at some point in their lives. It is a very isolating and overwhelming condition which can make friendships, relationships and even keeping down a job very difficult.

It can also lead to substance abuse and other mental health issues. Francis Cleary was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder at the age of 27. He knew he had to do something to help people who were going through the same problem.

He founded Step Out Ireland which creates a welcoming and safe space for people with social anxiety disorder to meet and talk with one another. Its aim is to facilitate meaningful connection so that social confidence and a sense of belonging can be fostered. Step Out Ireland hosts facilitated meetings in locations around Ireland and is already changing lives across the country.

So far Social Entrepreneurs Ireland has supported over 200 big ideas which are having an enormous impact on lives across Ireland. Stay tuned to see how these ideas grow and scale over the coming years. And keep a look out for our call out in March as we look for more people to Think Big, Act Now and Change Ireland.

Hero dog helps to save five-year-old trapped in tumble dryer,"A FIVE-YEAR old who became trapped in a tumble dryer at his home in Bangor, Co. Down, was rescued with the aid of the family dog, Teddy, who alerted the boy’s mother that he was in danger.

Riley Gedge-Duffy became trapped after the door closed on the dryer, which automatically turned on.

Teddy, however, managed to raise the alarm to Riley’s mother, who was vacuuming in another room, by barking loudly to notify her that something was wrong.

His father, Aaron Duffy, told BBC’s Good Morning Ulster: “The ambulance man says that another couple of minutes probably would have killed him.”

After the family called an ambulance, Riley was rushed to Ulster Hospital, Dundonald, where he was treated for burns to his arms, back and head.

A five-year-old boy who was trapped in a tumble dryer had his life saved by pet dog, family says https://t.co/ZqjgAIlHJh pic.twitter.com/VqL2Szb71u — BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) November 15, 2016

His father said that Riley, who has Down syndrome, is now on the mend. “He’s doing very well,” he said. “He’s up, he’s eating, he’s smiling. He’s the same old Riley.”

The setting on the tumble dryer means that once it is closed, it automatically turns on, and Aaron believes that Riley was extremely fortunate: “The risks are there. We’re one of the lucky ones who caught it in time.”

A spokesperson from the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service Health and Social Care Trust told TheJournal.ie that such an incident was “extremely rare” and indicated that if Riley had been in there a few more minutes, his injuries could have been far more severe.

This was not the first time that the two-year-old female cockapoo, a cross-breed mix between a poodle and a cocker spaniel, stepped in to alert the family that there was something wrong.

The father added: “The dog notified us before of an incident about to happen in the house. A phone charger was overheating and was catching fire. Only for the dog’s reactions on that day did my wife realise something was wrong this time.”

The family hope that Riley will be cleared to return home from hospital in the coming days.

As for Teddy, Aaron told RTE: “[He'll] be getting a fillet steak.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/dog-saves-boy-3082527-Nov2016/,the_journal,1

Lonely Planet names Skellig Ring as top destination for 2017,"THE SKELLIG RING in Co Kerry has been named one of the top ten regions travellers should visit in 2017 by Lonely Planet.

It is the gateway to Skellig Michael and the Little Skellig and is located close to the famous Ring of Kerry.

Here’s what Lonely Planet has to say about the destination:

“A long time ago, far, far away… a small band of monks established a hidden base on a remote, wave-pounded hunk of rock rising out of the Atlantic like a giant triangle. With a setting like this, it’s no wonder Skellig Michael made the new Star Wars location list.

To get to this far-flung isle, a boat trip is necessary from the Skellig Ring, perhaps Ireland’s most charismatically wild and emerald stretch of coastline. Glimpsed at the end of The Force Awakens, Skellig Michael will play a bigger role in this year’s sequel and local businesses are gearing up for the expected visitor bump.

Nóirín Hegarty, operations director with Lonely Planet in Ireland, told Morning Ireland Skellig Michael’s appearance in Star Wars is not the only reason the location was chosen for the list, but said the film will open “this part of the world to a whole new generation of cinemagoers”.

Hegarty said the area’s untouched landscape is relatively unique, noting it has been “pretty much untouched since the sixth century when the monks lived there”.

Over 13,000 people visited Skellig Michael this year. It is closed to the public from October to April.

Hegarty said Lonely Planet is “very much about sustainable tourism” and uses its travel lists to “identify places that people haven’t thought of or have perhaps overlooked”.

The top 10 regions in Lonely Planet’s Best in Travel 2017 are:

1. Choquequirao, Peru

2. Taranaki, New Zealand

3. The Azores, Portugal

4. North Wales, UK

5. South Australia

6. Aysén, Chile

7. The Tuamotus, French Polynesia

8. Coastal Georgia, USA

9. Perak, Malaysia

10. The Skellig Ring, Ireland

Tourism Minister Shane Ross welcomed the news, saying: “I am delighted that The Skellig Ring is being internationally recognised as a place of rugged and ethereal beauty.

“An integral part of our Wild Atlantic Way, it is a place both wild and majestic. The early monks who settled in this area believed they had reached the edge of the world and anyone who has travelled The Skellig Ring can appreciate the co-existing impressions of timelessness and mortality the landscape evokes.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/skellig-ring-lonely-planet-3044753-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
embrace this weird but delicious vegetable,"GLOBE ARTICHOKES ARE no relation to Jerusalem artichoke, which means we don’t have to have any flatulence jokes this week (thank God for that).

Whereas Jerusalem artichokes produce enormous yields of underground knobbly tubers (gotta love a knobbly tuber), globe artichokes are grown for the dense and delicious ‘hearts’ that are inside flowerheads which grow on top of a massive thistle-like plant.

They are, quite frankly, incredibly low yielding for such a big plant (you get about a dozen artichoke hearts in a season on each plant), and they are damn fiddly to cook with – but on the flipside they are quite the delicacy, the plants are beautiful in their own right and are perennial so with a bit of luck it will go on producing for about five years.

Globe artichokes are incredibly and surprisingly strong nutrition-wise – they’ve a higher antioxidant hit than cranberries or blueberries, and more dietary fibre than beans and oats.

They have also been proven to lower cholesterol, and have positive impact on the liver and brain. In fact globe artichokes came out as the fourth most nutritious veg in a US Department of Agriculture study. Besides, there’s something somewhat loveable about a food where you really need a tutorial to figure out how to prep and cook the damn thing.

Sowing

Growing from seed is possible, but many GIYers use more reliable “offsets” which are the side shoots from an established plant which you will get in a good garden centre. They will need a very fertile soil in a sunny, sheltered position.

To grow from seed, sow seeds in module trays indoors in March – plant them on into larger 10cm pots and plant out in June after hardening off. Space them at least one meter apart. Cover the plants with fleece if there is a risk of frost. Offsets are planted about 5cm deep. Trim the leaves to 13cm after planting.

Growing

Keep plants weed free and water well. In the first year remove the flowerhead as soon as it appears – this will give you a better crop the next year (sounds great in theory, but not so hot if you are an instant gratification kind of person).

At this time of the year you can start to think about preparing the plants for the winter, removing any dead stems and dying foliage.

Fork over the soil around the plants and then put a thick layer of well rotted manure or compost around them. Give them a high potash liquid feed in the spring.

Harvesting

Yeah, so this is where things get interesting. Harvest the largest, top globe first when it turns fat and soft and just before the scales start to open out. Cut a short length of stalk with it. Then harvest the other heads as they mature.

You will get approx a dozen of them between June and August. Globe Artichokes will produce globes every year for three – four years and then they start to produce progressively less. At this stage, it’s worth propagating new plants by cutting offsets from old ones.

To prep an artichoke globe, slice off the top quarter with a knife and then use a scissors to snip off the ends of the remaining petals as they are a little sharp. Once prepped like this they can be then either grilled, baked, boiled or steamed.

Once cooked, there’s ‘flesh’ on the back of each little petal which you can eat (dipped in your favourite sauce – alioli, mayo or melted butter). Once you’ve removed all the petals you get to a fuzzy ‘choke’ which you remove with the stem – you’re finally at the good stuff – the heart.

Problems

I’ve found globe artichokes to be relatively problem free apart from the usual suspects – snails, slugs, aphids etc.

GIY Tips

1. Make sure you water the plants well in the summer – if they don’t have enough H2O you will end up with disappointingly small globes.

2. Just-cut globe artichokes can be cooked much quicker than shop-bought ones – cooking time is reduced to about 7-10 minutes.

Recipe of the Week – Baby Artichoke Bruschetta

This recipe for artichoke bruschetta from Jamie’s Italian is amazing. He bills this as “super easy” on his website which I’d take a little issue with.

If you’re just starting out with artichokes you’re likely to spend a lot of time scratching your head, but persevere – it’s delicious. Serves four.

"Argentina's ""cowboy priest"" to become country's first saint after performing two ""miracles""","NICOLAS FLORES WAS supposed to live the rest of his life in a vegetative state, but today he walks, talks and swims – one of the miracles attributed to a “cowboy priest” who will become Argentina’s first saint today.

Sixteen years ago, when Nicolas was nearly killed in a car crash, his father prayed to a late priest named Jose Gabriel Brochero, who is revered in Argentina for his supposedly miraculous healing powers.

Brochero, a blind leper who lived from 1840 to 1914, was known for traveling on a mule across the vast Argentine pampas, or plains, to minister to the poor.

He was beatified, or declared blessed, in 2013 by his fellow Argentine, Pope Francis, who called him a “shepherd who smelled of sheep, (who) became poor among the poor”.

Like his compatriot the pope, Brochero was known for his ascetic lifestyle and his love of mate – a strong tea drunk from a gourd that is Argentina’s national beverage.

He is often depicted wearing the colorful poncho of Argentina’s gauchos, or cattle herders, his mate gourd in hand.

Nicolas’s father, Osvaldo Flores, is convinced Brochero’s intercession saved his then-infant son, whose head was crushed in the car accident, and who went into cardiac arrest three times at the hospital.

“Nico is Father Brochero’s miracle,” he said.

He isn’t the only one who thinks so.

The Catholic Church’s Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which oversees the complex process of canonisation, has credited Brochero with at least two posthumous miracles, clearing the way for him to become a saint.

‘Inexplicable’ recovery

Nicolas was just 11 months old when the car he was traveling in with his mother and grandparents was involved in a horrible crash, killing his grandfather and leaving the others in critical condition.

Emergency workers declared him dead at the scene, before realizing he was breathing faintly.

“It’s almost inexplicable the boy survived,” said pediatrician Carlos Rezzonico, who participated in a case study of Nicolas at the Vatican’s request.

At his office, the 89-year-old doctor shows brain scans of Nicolas’s head. The left half of his skull is empty space.

“If I didn’t know the patient, I would say this person had major neurological damage,” said Rezzonico.

“It’s inexplicable from a medical point of view” that the 16-year-old’s cognitive and motor functions are not more impaired, he said.

Nicolas has some difficulty speaking, but is a largely functional teenager.

He cheers for his favorite football team, River Plate; attends a specialised school; swims; and goes to physical therapy twice a week for his injuries.

“Nico has an energy and will power that surprise me every day,” said his physical therapist, Yanina Paola Varas.

Nicolas, like his parents, is convinced he owes his good fortune to Father Brochero.

“I get butterflies in my stomach when people talk to me about it,” he said.

Saved from coma

A young girl named Camila Brusotti is the second miracle attributed to Brochero.

In 2013, when she was nine years old, she was rushed to the hospital after being severely beaten by her mother and stepfather.

As the couple blamed each other for her injuries during a police interrogation, the girl’s grandmother prayed to Father Brochero.

Camila spent months in a coma. Doctors said she would probably live the rest of her life in a vegetative state.

But today, she is completely normal.

Her parents went to prison. Her grandmother is raising her to keep praying to Father Brochero – like thousands of pilgrims who flock each year to a small town in central Argentina that bears the priest’s name, Villa Cura Brochero.

Tasmanian devils could hold the key in a battle to save the lives of 10 million humans,"MOTHER’S MILK FROM the marsupials known as Tasmanian devils could help the global fight against increasingly deadly “superbugs” which resist antibiotics.

Superbugs are bacteria which cannot be treated by current antibiotics and other drugs, with a recent British study saying they could kill up to 10 million people globally by 2050.

Scientists at the University of Sydney found that peptides in the marsupial’s milk killed resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant golden staph bacteria and enterococcus that is resistant to the powerful antibiotic vancomycin.

The researchers turned to marsupials like the devil — which carry their young in a pouch after birth to complete their development — because of their biology.

The underdeveloped young have an immature immune system when they are born, yet survive growth in their mother’s bacteria-filled pouch.

“We think this has led to an expansion of these peptides in marsupials,” University of Sydney PhD candidate Emma Peel, who worked on the research published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports, told AFP.

“Marsupials have more peptides than other mammals. In the devil we found six, whereas humans have only one of this type of peptide.

“Other research in other marsupials has shown that tammar wallabies have eight of these peptides and opossums have 12,” said Peel, adding that studies into koala’s milk had now started.

Tasmanian devils are known for their voracious appetite. Source: Rob Griffith

The scientists artificially created the antimicrobial peptides, called cathelicidins, after extracting the sequence from the devil’s genome, and found they “killed the resistant bacteria… and other bacteria”.

They are hopeful marsupial peptides could eventually be used to develop new antibiotics for humans to aid the battle against superbugs.

“One of the most difficult things in today’s world is to try and find new antibiotics for drug-resistant strains of bacteria,” the research manager of the university’s Australasian Wildlife Genomics Group, Carolyn Hogg, told AFP.

Most of the other previous antibiotics have come from plants, moulds and other work that’s been around for close to a 100 years, so it’s time to start looking elsewhere.

World Health Organisation director-general Margaret Chan warned last month some scientists were describing the impact of superbugs as a “slow-motion tsunami” and the situation was “bad and getting worse”.

"The 'male pill' could be coming, it's in jab form and it works","A MALE CONTRACEPTIVE jab has proven to be 96% effective but reported side-effects could delay it being made widely available.

The Guardian reports that a trial of 350 men saw them being given injections of hormones that effectively stops the production of sperm.

The men were given an initial injection and continued to use other birth control methods before entering the “efficacy phase” of the study. At that point they stopped using other methods and received more jabs every two months.

The hormones involved were progestogen, to switch off sperm production, and testosterone to balance out the drop in the male hormone.

The efficacy rate of 96% is similar to that achieved by the female combined pill.

The trial was judged to have “unacceptable side-effects” including depression, acne and increased libido with 20 men dropping out of the trial early.

Early stages of the trial in 2011 also had to be halted due to the side-effects reported.

Of the 1,491 incidents reported during the early stages of the study, 39% were found to be unrelated to the treatment. These included one suicide and one man who reported irregular heartbeats.

Despite the side-effects reported by some, three-quarters of the men who completed the study said they would be willing to use the contraceptive jab on a long-term basis.",https://www.thejournal.ie/male-pill-test-3050990-Oct2016/,the_journal,1

meaning you could be due more tax back than usual,"DON’T WRITE OFF 2015 as a dud-year yet – because last year could be putting more money in your pocket.

There are 52 weeks and one day in a normal 365-day year, so the extra day each year accumulates and every five to six years, this creates a ‘week 53’ scenario, where 53 weekly payments occur within a year.

Last year, 31 December fell on a Thursday, making 2015 a kind of ‘tax leap year’. This means that employees who were weekly, fortnightly or four-weekly paid will have had an additional weekly/ fortnightly/ four-weekly payment.

Meaning you could be owed an extra week’s worth of tax back for 2015.

There is a caveat though – the amount of tax you’re owed is dependent on your particular circumstances, and can sometimes result in you owing the Revenue tax.

How to claim your tax back

This extra week’s worth of tax is included in the tax you claim back for the year - and can be claimed by requesting a PAYE balancing statement, or a P21 statement, at the end of each year.

A P21 is a review of income tax and USC liability for the year. It contains details of total income from all sources and gives a breakdown of tax credits, income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) paid.

You can claim your P21 up to four years back – meaning you can claim tax back from four years ago, and if you haven’t claimed tax back before, you’re in for a minor windfall.

The quickest and easiest way to request a P21 is by using PAYE Anytime or completing the eForm 12 which is accessible through Revenue’s online tool myAccount. Taxpayers can register for myAccount here.

Once you register, requesting your form is as simple as clicking on a year, then a button that says ‘request P21 form’.

If you do request the form online, your form will usually arrive in the post within five working days – with the amount of tax you’re due back attached in cheque form.

The news of Ward’s move to MMA’s biggest stage has come as a surprise, as the Straight Blast Gym fighter — a team-mate of UFC featherweight champion Conor McGregor — has competed in just four professional bouts, having made his debut in May of last year.

After losing his first professional fight via second-round KO to current BAMMA middleweight champion John Phillips, Ward has won three fights in a row.

Tragically, Carvalho took ill after the fight and he died two days later in Beaumont Hospital. Ward returned to MMA in June, when he overcame Gareth Williams by majority decision.

Randy Brown will be competing in the UFC for the fourth time in his career. The Jamaican native will be looking for this third win with the organisation.

The maps have been published in a new book and accompanying exhibition that includes illustrations of Galway dating back nearly six centuries.

The atlas has details of over 2,500 sites that explore how the city developed from Gaelic fortifications in the early 12th century to becoming an Anglo-Norman seaport a century later.

Archaeologist Paul Walsh of the National Monuments Service is one of the authors of the atlas.

He explains that the modern city of Galway developed as a trading port at the mouth of Lough Corrib, with commodities like hide and tallow being exported and iron, salt and spices coming in.

“Galway is synonymous with water,” he says, adding that trade to and from the city would have reached as far as Spain.

The trading route of Lough Corrib itself saw produce coming down to the port and also then produce coming in at the port from seafaring expeditions. It was a perfect situation for trading purposes. And the entrepreneurs of the time capitalised on that because it was the only big western seaboard town that had a safe anchorage where ships could come in.

This new publication is the 28th Irish town to be illustrated as part of the Irish Historic Towns Atlas, an initiative that was founded in 1981 as part of the Royal Irish Academy.

Other towns previously featured including Kells, Bandon and Belfast.

The reproduced maps are collated following years of research in libraries and repositories in both Ireland and Britain. The majority of the maps used in the Galway collection were sourced from Britain.

Among the sites that are covered are sixteenth century mills, bakeries, inns and tower houses as well as the seventeenth-century market places, forts and schools, gallows and bowling greens.

The oldest map in the Galway/Gaillimh atlas dates back to July 1583 and was sketched by a Connacht provost named Barnaby Googe. Another sketch map has been dated at just one month later.

Walsh says that people familiar with Galway city will be struck by just how similar the layout of the city today is to that which was sketched almost 600 years ago.

It’s an absolutely wonderful sketch map that shows Galway very much as it is today. The street pattern hasn’t changed in the heart of Galway and what’s shown on his map still survives and it’s quite a remarkable thing to see.

“If you look up at the streetscape you’ll see bits and pieces like hood moulding and various other pieces that go back to the emerging city as we call it from the 15th century.”

One of the most impressive surviving features is remnants of the fourteenth-century De Burgo Hall located at Flood Street. The foundations of the building as part of the modern-day Custom House and are still visible.

An exhibition of the newly reproduced maps and illustrations was opened yesterday at Galway City Museum by President and native Tribesman Michael D Higgins.

The exhibition will run for a number of months and is free to attend.

The creators of the Muppets want this cartoon to help kids save the planet,"CORAL REEFS MAY be dying off at an alarming rate and pollution and overfishing emptying the seas. But fear not. Help is at hand in the form of a new wave of cartoon superheroes determined to save the oceans.

While Disney blockbusters Finding Nemo and Finding Dory have been attacked for sparking a spike in the poaching of tropical fish, Muppets creators the Jim Henson Company said that their new animated children’s series Splash and Bubbles would help mobilise a new generation to save the undersea world.

The big-budget 40-episode series, which will screen on PBS in the United States next year, aims to “turn the tide of our world to save the planet”.

The generation left to solve the problems

Boss Lisa Henson, daughter of Jim Henson, the puppetry genius behind The Muppets and Sesame Street, said the series, which was premiered at the MIPJUNIOR festival in the French resort of Cannes, comes at a vital time.

While four to seven-year-olds may not be able to do much now to tackle the millions of tonnes of plastic waste that have created the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, she said it is “their generation who will be left to solve” such problems.

The series comes in the wake of the huge success of The Octonauts, the most watched cartoon by pre-school children in Britain, Ireland and Australia.

‘Star Trek’ meets Jacques Cousteau

The “edutainment” show has a team of animated animals rescuing sea creatures from their base in the Octopod.

With its catchphrase slogans of Explore! Rescue! Protect! it has been described as Star Trek meets Jacques Cousteau.

And now film-makers are working with the Monaco oceanographic museum which the legendary French marine explorer ran for decades to create another series about child heroes fighting for marine conservation.

Pirates of the Abyss will feature four friends who go off on aquatic adventures in an old submarine to right the wrongs of pollution and the over-exploitation of the oceans.

Producer Aymeric Castaing told AFP that the series — aimed at slightly older kids — would tap into their anger and impotence at what is happening to the environment.

“The world we live in will soon be in the hands of these kids. It is they who will have to save the oceans,” he added.

Castaing said the children begin their quest after chancing upon on a laboratory left behind by “some of the greatest brains of the past” including Jules Verne, the inventor Nikola Tesla, Gustave Eiffel and Prince Albert I of Monaco, an early marine researcher.

“These geniuses from the past are in a way helping them save the future,” said Castaing, co-founder of the Bordeaux-based I Can Fly studio.

‘Good values’

Source: YouTube

Henson said like Sesame Street, Splash and Bubbles was also all about teaching children good values in a fun way.

“You would not believe how diverse the ocean floor is… There are seahorse single dads with 499 children,” she joked.

And it is the seahorse dads who give birth. There is so much weird stuff there.

She said although the show took its mission to education seriously, with “today’s Jacques Cousteau marine biologist Dr Sylvia Earle” among its advisors, she insisted it was “not preachy”.

We are opening up the weird and wonderful world” of marine science and conservation through fun adventures and music.

“And we are showing the oceans amazing diversity and interconnectedness,” she added.

Nevertheless, each 11-minute episode will be cut with a humorous documentary segment called Get Your Feet Wet, where children will “find out for instance that octopuses have no bones”.

Henson’s distribution boss Richard Goldsmith said it was in the “studio’s DNA” to promote “good and solid values” and that “Jim Henson was thinking about ecology and diversity long before it was cool”.

Far from overwhelming children with the planet’s problems, he said the show’s purpose was to empower them to confront them.

“One of (lead character) Splash’s favourite sayings is, ‘There is only one way to get over the fear of the unknown and that is to go there and find out about it’,” Goldsmith added.

Boil water notice lifted in Roscommon after 2.5 years,"A BOIL WATER notice has been lifted in Co Roscommon after two-and-a-half years.

In a joint statement released by Irish Water and Roscommon County Council today, customers on the North East Roscommon Regional Water Supply Scheme were told that the boil water notice issued in March 2014 has been lifted with immediate effect.

It was put in place after cryptosporidium was detected in the water supply.

People can now resume normal use of the water supply for drinking, food preparation and brushing teeth.

Irish Water said it invested €800,000 in installing a temporary water treatment plant at Lisheen Lake to deal with the issue.

“This a temporary solution for the interim period until such time as the permanent water treatment plant is commissioned and fully operational,” the company said in a statement.

Laura Heneghan of Irish Water stated: “The interim solution is providing a robust and reliable treatment process for the 3,000 people on the scheme and is ensuring that the drinking water meets all EU and Irish Water standards.”

The permanent treatment plant is due to be complete next year. The statement added:

Irish Water and Roscommon County Council would like to thank the general public for their patience, cooperation and assistance during the period of the boil water notice and greatly regrets any inconvenience caused to householders, the farming and the business communities.

Local TD Michael Fitzmaurice welcomed the news, saying he will work to make sure “a permanent solution takes place as soon as possible”.",https://www.thejournal.ie/roscommon-boil-water-notice-3026736-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
Independent distillers and brewers are funding themselves by offering 'bragging rights' to fans,"MAKING CRAFT BEER can be hand-to-mouth stuff, no matter how successful you are.

So says Paul Mullin, managing director of The White Hag Irish Brewing Company in county Sligo, which plans to bankroll its barrel-aged beer through a crowdfunding project.

Barrel aging is a slow, expensive process. The beer is put into a barrel that was previously used to hold wine, whiskey, brandy or sherry. The brewer adds yeast to the mix and then waits one to two years for the beer to mature.

The retail value for barrel-aged beers is high, but they can only be made in small batches because production is so labour-intensive.

“This is a style of beer that has been much in demand,” Mullin tells Fora. “It’s like a high-end cognac or a grand wine. It’s in the upper end of the beer scale.”

Paul Mullin Source: The White Hag Irish Brewing Company

Mullin says he knew there was an appetite for that type of beer when White Hag’s first barrel-aged series, Black Boar, was added to the tasting menu at Michelin-starred restaurant Chapter One.

“We said we need to do this at scale, which doesn’t mean millions of litres,” he says. “We wanted to gather enough barrels so we could have a really good run of barrel-aged beers that we could sell across Ireland and Europe next year.”

The challenge was finding a way to fund the project up front.

Normally, there is a 10-week lead-in from when the brewery invests in the raw materials to getting it out to shops or behind bars, Mullin says.

“For cash flow, you don’t get the money in for another month or two months, depending on who the customer is.

“If you’re putting a huge amount of resources and material and product into a barrel for 12 months, then the pay-off time and cash flow takes a serious hit. We really couldn’t afford to do it.”

To kick-start the barrel-aged initiative, the company has launched an programme where fans can adopt a barrel in exchange for alcohol.

Customers pay €250 for a 225-litre barrel and gain returns from that barrel for the next three years.

“We came up with a way to ensure that people who like the brewery and like the beer and like our style got a chance to support us in a small way. The pay-off is, you invest €250 in us now and we’ll give you €360 worth of beer back over three years. We’re getting real beer nerds buying the consumer barrels.

“What it essentially means is that we can add 2,500 litres of capacity to our fermentation without having to worry about funding that up front.”

As well as getting beer, investors will be invited to The White Hag’s birthday party in the brewery.

There are 100 barrels set aside for individual buyers with another 10, larger barrels – 500 litres each – for commercial customers. Mullin says there is only one large barrel left to adopt while over 80 of the consumer barrels have been sold.

‘Lifestyle investment’

However the White Hag is from the only company in the drinks business that’s using crowdfunding to bankroll expensive projects.

Boann Distillery in Co Meath has launched a ‘cask society’, where 500 casks of whiskey will be offered to customers with prices starting at €5,800. The first handful of customers joined the society this week.

Pat Cooney, who co-founded Boann, describes the venture as “a lifestyle investment”, as opposed to a commercial investment.

Cooney – who sold his drinks distribution business, the Gleeson Group, to beer giant C&C in 2012 – says that, for customers, the project is about “learning the story and the making of whiskey”.

The Cooney family Source: Boann Distillery

“They can come along (to the distillery). They can distill the whiskey, put their name or coat of arms on the barrel, put the barrel in the cellar, age it for three years. At the end of the three years, they can age it longer, blend some of it or age it with older whiskeys. They are involved in the distilling every stage along the way.”

As well as getting at least 200 litres of bourbon, sherry or port in return, members will be invited to an annual cask society dinner where they can meet their “colleagues in arms”.

For Boann – which is not yet fully operational and won’t start distilling until early next year – the initiative covers some of the cost in setting up, but Cooney says it will also help the company “identify with customers and build a relationship with them”.

Exclusivity

Dingle Distillery had a couple of different fundraising schemes on the go to cover a chunk of its initial operational costs. The one that gained the most publicity was the ‘founding fathers’ members club.

The fist 500 casks of whiskey produced in the distillery were pre-sold to individuals for at least €6,000 each.

The casks are housed in Dingle for five years, after which investors are given three options: they can keep the casks in the distillery for longer, bottle it themselves or sell it back to Dingle Distillery.

Source: Dingle Whiskey Distillery

The majority of the casks were sold in 2013 and most of them will be matured by 2018.

In hindsight, “we could have done a lot more than 500,” Peter Mosley, co-owner of Dingle Distillery, tells Fora, before adding that “the exclusivity might have been lost” if production was increased to 1,000.

Mosley says that many of the founding fathers have “become involved in the distillery in an informal, ambassadorial role”.

He says some of them bought into the scheme from a financial perspective, with the hope of selling the whiskey to a third-party, but many others “wanted it because it is, in some sense, historic”.

“It was the first distillery of its type to be built in Ireland in 150 to 200 years,” he says. “There’s an element of some people just wanted it for bragging rights. They could say they have their own cask in Dingle.”

Networking

Similar to the crowdfunding initiatives run by The White Hag and Boann, the founding fathers are invited to an annual party in Dingle village, which “works quite well for them as a networking event”.

The €3 million generated through the membership scheme covered part of the set-up costs, but “didn’t go a tremendous way”, Mosley says.

While the distillery waits for its whiskies to mature, it has been selling vodka and gin, the latter of which has taken off as a brand in its own right.

“We’d like to say that we looked into a crystal ball and that we knew gin was going to be the next fashionable drink,” Mosley says. “There may have been a little bit of that. Certainly, there was some growing interest in gin, but we didn’t expect it to be quite as big as it is.

“In many ways, we started off as a whiskey distiller with a bit of gin on the side … Now, we’re as much a gin distillery with whiskey on the side. That will change as we start to release whiskey on the market.”

He says Dingle Gin has helped raise the profile of the business, which Mosley expects will “make it easier when we knock on the door with a case of whiskey in our hand”.

Pope Francis has opened up his summer holiday home to tourists because he's not using it much,"WHO NEEDS A summer palace?

Not Pope Francis, who has renounced the delights of Castel Gandolfo outside Rome and opened his private apartments to tourists, the Vatican said today.

The Argentine has refused the traditional trappings of the papacy from the start, declining to move into the sumptuous papal apartment in the Vatican and plumping instead to live in a hotel inside the tiny city state.

His rooms at Castel Gandolfo, a former summer favourite with popes hoping to escape the heat of the capital, have been turned into a museum which will be officially inaugurated on 21 October.

Francis has visited the palace some 25 kilometres from Rome only a couple of times since his election in 2013, and has never spent the night there.

His predecessors John Paul II (1978-2005) and Benedict (2005-2013) often stayed at the site, which has been owned by the Holy See since 1596 and has expanded over the centuries to now sprawl over 55 hectares (135 acres).

Francis opened the estate’s gardens to the public in 2014, with tours organised for groups and by reservation only.

Since last year, tourists have also been able to climb aboard a special white train for an express trip to the lavish estate and a tour of the papal villa, including past the pope’s organic farm, which houses cows, free-range hens, cockerels and pontifical bees.

Why does the naked mole rat feel no pain and not get cancer?,"THE AFRICAN NAKED mole rat may be one of nature’s oddest-looking creatures, but it’s also the toughest.

These small rodents can live for 32 years, they are cancer-resistant, and they are impervious to some types of pain.

Now, new research has pinpointed the evolutionary change that made the naked mole rat so uniquely pain-free, according to a study published on Tuesday in Cell Reports.

“We think evolution has selected for this tweak just subtly enough so that the pain signaling becomes non-functional, but not strong enough that it becomes a danger for the animal,” says lead author Gary R Lewin, a professor at the Max-Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin, Germany.

Imagine the sting of entering a hot tub with a bad sunburn. The naked mole rat wouldn’t be bothered, but most animals would sense this as thermal hyperalgesia, and the scientists who conducted the study have a good idea of what goes on at a cellular level when this happens.

In response to high temperatures and inflammation around sensory neurons, nerve growth factor (NGF) molecules bind to a receptor called TrkA.

Source: AP/Press Association Images

This kicks off a cascade of chemical signals that “sensitise” an ion channel — called TRPV1 — on the surface of the sensory neuron so that it opens. Once TRPV1 opens, it results in sensory nerve firing that tells the brain to register pain at temperatures that are not normally painful.

Through more than a dozen carefully designed experiments, Lewin and colleagues found what differentiates the naked mole rat from other animals in this process — a small change in their TrkA receptor.

For example, if the scientists swapped out the TRPV1 channels in a mouse cell for naked mole rat versions of TRPV1, then thermal hyperalgesia occurred normally. But if a cell had a common rat TRPV1 and a naked mole rat TrkA, then the cell couldn’t sense thermal hyperalgesia.

Losing thermal hyperalgesia might help the naked mole rats survive in their crowded underground colonies, where the close contact can be uncomfortably hot but thermal hyperalgesia may not be helpful in this warm environment. And it’s possible that losing sensory neurons as adults may help the animals conserve energy.",https://www.thejournal.ie/naked-mole-rat-feels-no-pain-3022445-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
a baby who has quite literally been born twice,"File photo Source: Shira Gal

LYNLEE HOPE BOEMER is a unique child – she holds the distinction of having been born twice.

Her mother, Texas native Margaret, went for a routine ultrasound scan at 16 weeks only to hear the last news anyone wants to hear – her baby was very sick.

Lynlee Hope had a tumour known as a sacrococcygeal teratoma, that affects one in every 35,000 infants.

Boemer had already been through one tragedy in the course of her pregnancy – Lynlee had initially been a twin but the other baby had been lost.

“They saw something on the scan, and the doctor came in and told us that there was something seriously wrong with our baby,” Margaret told CNN.

Source: CNN/Facebook

And it was very shocking and scary, because we didn’t know what that long word meant or what diagnosis that would bring

At 16 weeks of pregnancy, the only option to treat Lynlee’s tumour was emergency foetal surgery. When performed, the tumour was nearly as large as Lynlee herself.

The surgery itself was performed at 23 weeks and five days. It lasted five hours.

Lynlee was almost entirely removed from the womb so the surgery could be performed.

“”The part on the foetus we do very, very quickly,” surgeon Darrell Cass told CNN.

It’s only 20 minutes or so on the actual foetus.

The rest of the operation is spent opening and shutting the uterus Cass explained.

The baby is “hanging out in the air… essentially, the foetus is outside, like completely out, all the amniotic fluid falls out, it’s actually fairly dramatic,” he said.

Following the successful surgery, Lynlee was placed back in the womb and Margaret, already a mother-of-two, was confined to bed for the remainder of the pregnancy.

That came to an end on 6 June when Lynlee Hope, aged almost 36 weeks, was born for a second time, at a healthy five pounds, five ounces. The remains of the tumour that could not be removed first time round were taken away in a further operation eight days later.

And she continues to thrive.

“Baby Boemer is still an infant but is doing beautiful,” Cass said.",https://www.thejournal.ie/lynlee-hope-boemer-born-twice-3044377-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
The world's tallest tower has broken ground,"THE TALLEST TOWER in the world began construction this week.

Work began on The Tower at Dubai Creek Harbour on Monday, starting a process that will see the structure climb above the Burj Khalifa.

The structure “will be the world’s tallest tower when completed in 2020,” said a statement issued at the ceremony.

Dubai’s developer giant Emaar Properties announced plans to build the viewing tower in April, saying it will be “a notch” higher than Burj Khalifa, which stands 828 metres high. However, the company hasn’t revealed the height of the tower.

The entire building will cost around €900 million and is designed by Spanish-Swiss architect Santiago Calatrava, best known here for being the man behind the Samuel Beckett Bridge in Dublin. He also known for the transport hub at the new World Trade Centre, the Caja Obelisk in Madrid and Museum of Tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro.

In April, Emaar said the tower will be slender, evoking the image of a minaret, and will be anchored to the ground with sturdy cables.

It will contain three public observation decks, a cafe, events spaces and The Pinnacle Room, an events space and 360 viewing platform. It will have balconies capable of rotating out of the building.

"26.2 miles later: 'You started something, played the long game and you finished it. Job done.'","LAST WEEK, WRITER Sarah Geraghty shared why she signed up to the SSE Dublin City Marathon for the first time. Here’s how Sunday unfolded…

The day before the marathon, picking my cousin up at the airport, a week-long cloud of doubt had lifted. I was excited, giddy, on a ‘let’s do this’ buzz.

Is that how you’re supposed to feel? I had no idea.

The giddiness wavered at the RDS where we collected our registration packs. A fake finish line was set up. Giddy people were having their photos taken at it.

“Why would you tempt fate like that? Will we get a photo at it? Oh god no, stop.”

Seventeen hours to go, said the countdown clock.

Back home, I gave my left calf a lash with one of those rollers for some reason.

At 9.15pm, my sister hits pause on the TV and says, “Right, bedtime, girls.”

The most pertinent advice for this stage came from the free magazine in our registration pack:

You may have trouble sleeping the night before. Don’t worry…if you’ve done the training you’ll go the distance with or without sleep.

I wake up at 5am, lie awake for 45 minutes and get up. Back on the excited buzz.

My dad appears, on it with the porridge and coffee. By 7.30am, cousin and I are already 20 minutes behind schedule – having photos taken outside with our marathon numbers.

It’s the autumn morning of dreams as my mum drives us into Dublin, passing the motivational signs around Bushy Park. We are raring to go.

In town and a tide of marathoners, our people, is surging towards Fitzwilliam Square.

“Niall, d’ya want a banana?”

Never had a banana before a run before, I won’t have one now.”

Dead right. Never try anything for the first time on the day itself, they say. Like, forget your earphones.

Sarah, Niall and cousin Dorothy on the start line. Source: Instagram

We run into a hotel, smothered in a glorious changing-room scent of Deep Heat, to use the bathroom and the vibes are electric and happy.

“Any tips?” I ask a woman doing her make-up beside me in the mirror (my take: wear makeup if you want to. There’s no shame. And you’ll be having your photo taken all day.)

Take it really, really slow at the start. Have fun, you’ll love it.

After handing your bag of stuff over a fence to the first of many kind, smiling Dublin Marathon volunteers, one last selfie, a few stretches and you’ve crossed the start-line.

You’re doing this.

Onto Leeson Street, cut through Camden Street, up the hill at St Patrick’s Cathedral, and down onto the quays.

It’s not even 10am and the pavements are alive with smiling, cheering, waving, high-fiving supporters. And you’re only hitting your first mile.

At times, a team sport

At Stoneybatter, Niall announces we did the first stretch in 10 minutes. Fears about rocketing off too fast are put to rest. We relax and fall into a comfortable pace.

He goes ahead – no hard feelings – and I spot some of my best friends, huddled together, holding up posters, shouting our names.

‘Is it going to be this emotional for another 24.2 miles?,’ I wonder.

Coming through the Phoenix Park, the replacement earphones are malfunctioning. The band and the crowds along Chesterfield Avenue are more uplifting than the laboriously assembled playlist.

For the first and last time, I take out my phone (catch sight of a message, “By the time you read this, you’ll have run a marathon. Isn’t that cool?” So cool, if this all works out) and issue a plea: “If anyone sees me, can I get some earphones?”

The network of communications between our cheer-squad is tight. Inside the gates at Castleknock, a friend throws a pair my way, with a hug and push.

At 10 miles, my cousin and I are still up for a giggle or, “look at the deer” or “ah Jesus, that’s lovely” as a dad hands over gels to his son.

Seasoned marathoners who advise against music may have a point.

On to Chapelizod and then the South Circular (11 miles), there are unexpected sightings of loved ones and with a rush of excitement every time, I leg it over for hugs.

At 12 miles (Dolphin’s Barn), my body is telling me to conserve the energy levels and tone down the love buzz.

It’s a new phase when the people lining the route mean even more. At 14 miles, my cousin and I part ways.

With no team-mate, a smile or a thumbs up or “you’re doing great, love” from a stranger is a mighty push forward.

Families clapping outside their houses, holding out bags of jellies, bowls of oranges and sliced up bananas, little ones lining up with their hands out for high fives, gardaí clapping us along.

Staggering acts of kindness, raising a smile, sometimes even a laugh. Home-made posters: “Go Mammy, if you could look after us three you can do this”; “Remember, you paid to do this”; “No more training runs after today”.

The way is now sticky underfoot, like a nightclub at 2am, from frantic draughts of energy gels.

At 17 miles, we’re at Bushy Park. I deny the existence of The Wall. On the other hand, I have no idea what time it is, or how long this is taking me. My hips are grinding into their joints.

I remember the person who told me, “Your legs will never give up on you.” I’m pretty sure my legs are about to do just that. If I stop running, jogging, or whatever I’m doing with my body at that point, I will never start again. And that would make for a truly miserable hobble to the finish.

Just when this internal struggle begins – ‘Would it matter if I stopped? Who’d even know? Sure wouldn’t everyone say you’re great anyway?’ – another great roar comes up from the crowd. And you’re back.

Past waving flags in Milltown – Munster, Leinster, Mayo (for Sam, of course) – and you’re pushing yourself up that Everest of a hill.

At 21 miles. I’m counting on my fingers now. Five to go.

Grand. Totally do-able. Just tell your legs – your hips – that.

Rounding onto Clonskeagh Road, two more friends are there, reminding all around of the nearby finish line. The husband-and-wife team who saw me flying it way back at 10 miles are with me again, following the route on their Dublin Bikes.

She runs alongside me as we approach Roebuck, spurring me on, making me laugh until energy levels start flashing red again, warning me to cop on.

A man sucking energy gels wants to small talk. Takes all sorts.

“You’re nearly there,” goes a communal roar at the UCD flyover – never more needed.

At RTÉ, the Stoneybatter cheer-squad is back in full force, joined by more friends and family. Less refined now, they’re screaming, running alongside with water, saying how they’ve tracked you the whole way around, knew you’d be here at this time.

“Look how far you’ve come, just keep going!”

Along Merrion Road, through Ballsbridge, the crowds explode. I don’t know how you’d get this far without them.

For the first time ever during a run of any length, I start to feel dangerously queasy.

“For the love of God, don’t get sick here,” I plead with myself.

Another friend appears. This one on the bridge at Northumberland Road:

Come ON Sarah, I’ll run you to the finish line.

But we’re closing in on 26 miles and my body is resisting a heroic sprint finish.

On Mount Street, the street widens, the running crowd has thinned out and there’s a clear run at that line. Carried the last few metres by the faces and cheers of loved ones on either side.

And after 4 hours, 14 minutes, and 18 seconds, I’m a finisher.

The crowds are behind you now. It’s just you in this quiet space. But it’s not an anti-climax, more a quiet, dazed moment of relief, disbelief and pride. A still moment to savour.

You started something, played the long game, and you finished it. Job done.

T-shirt and medal in hand, I hobble around Merrion Square through the barriers before braving the crush in Meeting Area 1. And there’s Dad.

A couple of days on, I feel like I have a small-to-medium sized hangover. The stairs are my nemesis.

“Well, what’s the next project?”

“Let’s give it a week, Dad”.

The 90-year-old television presenter spoke out after a gorilla briefly escaped last Thursday from its enclosure in London Zoo. Attenborough said the incident was “hardly surprising” when animals are subjected to intrusion.

He also said people should behave in a more respectful manner in zoos rather than clowning around trying to goad animals into a reaction.

But Attenborough, who has opened the eyes of millions of viewers to the wonders of the natural world during more than half a century in television, also said zoos play a vital role in preserving endangered species.

“They are wonderful animals, gorillas. They are animals which guard their privacy,” he told ITV television.

“In the forests of west Africa, they don’t live out in the open. They aren’t stared at by people.

Maybe the solution is that people should not be allowed to be behind big sheets of glass but look behind peepholes so that the gorillas don’t realise (they are being watched) — but that’s very difficult to do in a zoo where there are tens of thousands of people wanting to see these animals.

Attenborough called for zoo-goers to show more consideration to the animals.

“Sometimes visitors to zoos are not respectful and they start shrieking or waving their arms in order to get the poor gorilla to do something.

“They are not just animals. They are related to us. They value their privacy. Just imagine what it’s like to be there.”

Attenborough said it would be nice to think creatures such as mountain gorillas were safe in the wild but zoos did preserve species under threat of extinction.

“It’s a pity they’re always in danger,” he said.

“If we could get rid of that then perhaps there would be no need for zoos.

“It is important for people to be able to see what these wonderful creatures are like and to understand the responsibility that the human race has towards gorillas.”

'The land of a thousand hills' is now using drones to deliver medicine,"“THREE, TWO, ONE, launch!”

And with that, catapulted from a ramp, the small fixed-wing drone buzzes into the air towards its pre-programmed destination, the Kabgayi hospital two kilometres away.

On Friday, Rwanda inaugurated a drone operation that its backers hope will kickstart a revolution in the supply of medical care in rural parts of Africa, in the first instance by delivering batches of blood to 21 clinics in the west of the country.

Maternal mortality rates in Africa are among the highest in the world, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), largely due to postpartum haemorrhage caused by lack of access to simple blood transfusions.

Rwanda is no exception, and the situation here is worsened by the topography of a country dubbed “the land of a thousand hills” as well as intense seasonal rains making the transport of blood by road often long and difficult.

Blood “is a very precious commodity so you cannot just stock a lot of it in every single health centre,” said Keller Rinaudo, CEO of Zipline, a California-based robotics company that designed the 15 drones and the base housing them in Muhanga, 50 kilometres west of the capital Kigali.

Faster, more efficient

Rinaudo hopes his drone delivery system will “allow the Rwandan government to instantly deliver life-saving transfusions to any citizen in the country in 15 to 30 minutes.”

US package-delivery giant UPS and global vaccine alliance Gavi have invested $1.1 million (€1 million) in the Zipline project, one of a handful on the continent seeking to harness the potential of delivery drones to overcome poor infrastructure.

For the Rwandan government blood delivery by drone is not cheaper, but it promises to be much faster.

The drones dubbed “Zips” are shaped like a fat-bellied miniature plane with a two-metre wingspan.

They are battery-powered with a range of around 150 kilometres, weigh 13 kilos (29 pounds) and can carry a cargo of about 1.5 kilos, or three bags of blood.

Flying at up to 70 kilometres per hour, it is predicted each drone could make as many as 150 deliveries a day.

At the tent that serves as a launch station, Zipline technicians monitor the drones from laptops while others prepare the payload: small cardboard boxes with paper parachutes that will hold the transfusion blood and be dropped from a height of around 20 metres.

As the test flights were carried out curious residents peered through the fence, watching as the drones were flung into the air, returning after dropping their cargo at the hospital, and landing on an inflatable mattress.

Zipline plans to open a second base in Rwanda next year meaning the whole of the tiny country will be within range.

“These flights will save lives,” said Gregg Svingen, head of communications at UPS. “Today it is blood, tomorrow it will be vaccines.”

The maths gene? It all adds up to a myth,"THERE IS A strong and misguided belief in a broad segment of society that people are somehow genetically programmed to be good or bad at maths. When people say that they don’t have the maths gene it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

It is simply not true that some people can’t do maths and it is one of our goals to dispel this dangerous myth. The message of Maths Week, which is currently taking place across Ireland this week, from today, is that everyone can do maths. It’s just like any other subject.

Of course, not every child can go on to be a top mathematician but by the same token not everyone who plays football can represent Ireland. Everyone can do better at maths and sports and enjoy themselves at the same time.

No one would accept it if a person said they can’t do English, we need to engender the same attitude in relation to maths. If children have a positive experience of maths and get a sense of achievement out of mastering elements of the subject they will be motivated and will thrive at it.

Understand your phone plan and your payslip

Maths Week aims to help people understand the value and importance of maths in their everyday lives. The reality is that people need maths skills if they are to understand their phone price plans, calculate their household budgets, and make sense of their payslips. If you don’t understand what a percentage is how can you figure out the special offers in supermarkets or the taxation changes made by the Minister for Finance in the budget?

A recent OECD report found that under half of the UK participants reached the necessary standard in basic financial maths. Ireland didn’t participate in the study but there is no reason to believe we don’t have major problems with everyday financial reckoning.

When people say that they don’t have the maths gene it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

In many cases the basic reason why people don’t succeed at maths it is because they do not believe in their own mathematical ability. However, it is quite often the case that those same individuals exhibit very strong mathematical aptitude in other aspects of their lives.

Many people who haven’t achieved high standards in maths and who would claim they have no talent or feeling for maths may be able to add up darts scores at blindingly fast speeds and with total accuracy or work out the odds on a horse racing accumulator bet. They have no difficulty with addition, subtraction, multiplication, divisions, fractions or percentages in certain contexts and with practice. They clearly aren’t missing the mythical “maths gene”.

People have the potential to be good at maths even if they don’t realise it.

Maths Week is an opportunity to tap into the areas which people are motivated by and help guide them forwards from there. The week isn’t just for school-goers, however. It is for teachers and parents and the public as well.

The biggest predictor of children’s success at school is their parents and the educational ethos that is transmitted in the home. If we can convince parents that they and their children can do better at maths we will go a long way to achieving our goals.

As a nation we have to ensure that everyone does much better at maths. At the moment we are in the top half of the international maths classroom but if we are to realise our ambitions in terms of becoming a knowledge economy we need to do be at the top.

Ireland has a continuing demand for skilled workers in IT, engineering, science, financial services and other areas depending on mathematics. We can’t have a situation where we are importing all our skilled people. We need to raise everyone’s standards when it comes to maths.

Of course, not everyone can become a mathematician, an actuary or an engineer but by becoming better at maths they can become better at whatever job they do. Maths helps people in every aspect of their lives at home, at work, and in their understanding of the natural world.

Over the next number of days more than a quarter of a million schoolchildren and thousands of adults will take part in this all-Ireland celebration of all things mathematical. Maths Week promotes awareness, appreciation and understanding of maths through a huge variety of events and activities which are organised by a partnership of over 50 groups including universities, institutes of technology, colleges, museums, libraries, visitor centres, professional bodies and other organisations which understand the importance of maths to society.

Maths through the medium of clowns

Events are firmly focused on the fun as well as practical sides of mathematics with presentations from mathematical clowns, magicians, bubble artists and others taking place around the country.

Children can learn about the maths behind code making and breaking, internet searches, construction, and even juggling.

This is the eleventh year of Maths Week and it has grown in size every year since we started. Joining local presenters we have more than 20 international speakers and entertainers performing at events in over 50 venues around the country. In addition, most schools around in Ireland are organising their own events around the week.

The aim of all of these events is to take maths out of the text-book and show other aspects of the subject that the curriculum doesn’t have space for. To show that maths can be enjoyed rather than endured, and crucially that maths is for everyone.

"Fighting cancer with funny moustaches: ""We were not the norm. Cancer is very serious and we were not serious""","“WE SIT IN the privileged position that we came up with a brilliant idea – and everyone got on it… and then we harnessed it to help change the world.”

As statements go, it’s a big one – but the man talking about changing the world is Justin Coghlan (known as JC), one of the co-founders of the Movember Foundation charity.

If you see men sporting strange and wonderful moustaches in November, then you can blame Movember. (And if you can’t grow a moustache, there are other ways to be a Mo Bro or Mo Sista.) But what it has also been doing is raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for cancer charities across the world, including Ireland.

What started off as a once-off idea to celebrate a friend’s birthday in Australia has gone on to become a global movement.

On average globally, men die six years before women, while men suffer from illnesses and diseases that are often preventable through minor lifestyle changes. What Movember does is try to shine a light on ways to get men to the doctor early, and get them thinking about health as a priority.

Where it all began

JC

In 2003, friends Travis Garone and Luke Slattery held the first Movember in honour of Garone’s birthday in Melbourne. In 2004, they registered it as an official charity, raising over €30,000 for the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia. By 2006 it had received Australian charity status.

It soon gathered more participating countries, and Movember Ireland was official launched in 2008.

Neil Rooney, Movember director in Ireland, explained the impact of Movember fundraising here:

From money raised by Irish Mo Bros and Sistas, we now provide two full time nurses dedicated to helping men deal with the physical and mental side effects of prostate cancer who are based in Dublin and Galway.

In 2004, JC came on board to work with all things Movember in Queensland. When TheJournal.ie meets him 12 years later in Dublin, the charity has gone on to totally surpass his initial expectations.

Movember has raised over €516 million, and funded over 1200 projects focusing on prostate cancer, testicular cancer, poor mental health and physical inactivity. The Irish arm of Movember has linked up with groups like the Irish Cancer Society and there is already a rake of events planned for November this year.

“It was the perfect storm at the time,” says JC of Movember’s foundation. “It was like the Beatles – it was four very different people coming together and creating magic in men’s health.”

When they first started, the guys knew that Movember was something very new on the charity scene. “We were not the norm, charity is very conservative and cancer is very serious and we were not serious,” points out JC.

“We were doing a fun thing at that time which was just moustaches, for a serious cause.” That led them to coin the phrase “having fun doing good”.

The impact of Movember isn’t lost on the four Movember founders. “We are sitting here today humbled and privileged to be the world’s largest men’s health organisation,” says JC now.

But he says that what has kept him awake at night was that they didn’t waste the opportunity – or money. Instead, they’ve turned the charity into a massive, worldwide foundation that involves a dash of marketing, and perhaps even a spark of hipsterism too.

Changing lives

Movember’s aim, says JC, is to encourage men to get checked out so that prostate cancer can be detected early. If it’s caught early, you’ve got a 96% survival rate for five years and above, says JC.

“If you get detected after and you present late, it’s called metastasising – your survival rate for five years plus is 29%.”

“If you get checked early it’s a game-changer,” he says. “And that’s why we kind of took it on.” He says the charity has advanced prostate cancer by 50 years.

He doesn’t use the phrase “cure cancer”, because “no one’s ever gonna cure cancer – you will manage cancer, you will live with and beyond cancer”.

Did getting involved in Movember change how he took care of his health? “I didn’t find it difficult to talk about [beforehand], but it changed me. Because the more I got involved, and the more we did and more we expanded … I don’t wake up in a day now and I don’t have a conversation about suicide prevention.”

This is another element of the Movember work – trying to get guys to talk in an effort to prevent suicide rates from climbing. (The latest figures show that young men are at the greatest risk of suicide in Ireland.)

JC points out that as men get older “the big stuff” – illness, family changes, work changes – can happen. “[And] they’ve got no one to turn to.

So what we want men to do is check in with your mates before you check out. So it’s that one conversation. And women have this amazing… they can talk face to face [and] never lose their network, guys have this shoulder to shoulder, so you’ll be watching a sport event, you’ll be doing something or tinkering with something – that’s when guys are going to open up. They’re not even going to look at each other, they’re going to talk, ‘oh how’s that going’.

JC, also aims to get men to move 30 minutes a day – and understand their historical data. “If prostate cancer is in your family you are 2.5 times more likely to get it,” he points out.

“Walk for 30 minutes a day, understand what’s going to kill you, and you know it’s that old adage diet and exercise – you don’t have to be a triathlete, you just have to understand everyone is built differently.”

The changing face of charity

Movember was created around the same time as Facebook, and the latter has helped the spread of fundraising phenomena like the ice bucket challenge. Has this threatened Movember’s long-running work? Not in JC’s eyes.

“I applaud it,” he says. “People copy us all the time – not the ice bucket challenge but people copy us all the time and people go to me ‘oh they are ripping off Movember’. They are doing good, so let them do it, right? It doesn’t have to be about that.”

The biggest concern I personally have about the ice bucket challenge is they made so much money so fast and it had this rolling effect. I think it negatively impacted people giving, and not for us, and then it kind of exposed ‘oh that person got way too much money’… everyone started to question themselves in giving and that I think affected the whole industry and it changed perceptions on giving which is a good and a bad thing.

It’s not a bad thing for Movember, says JC, “cos we’re accountable for every dollar we spend”.

Despite the emergence of social-media based fundraising events, Movember has steadily been able to keep up – and grow – its work.

“We’re just so privileged, we get to wake up every day – we change the world, right,” enthuses JC.

“That’s a pretty powerful thing and if we can just save one man every day and do that for us we’re just kicking away at a journey.

“I know that sounds corny and cheesy but we want to change the world, that’s what we want to do and we think we’re doing a pretty good job of it with men’s health and we’ll continue to do that.”

Movember in Ireland

This year, Movember is hitting the road in Ireland to gather men’s health stories across the country.

Movember is capturing a national snapshot of men and women who have personal stories to share on men’s health, and will use these stories and images as part of their awareness and education campaign this year.

Declan Branagan, a survivor who is one of the participants from Dublin said:

Two years ago I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. As the founder and CEO of my company eXpd8, it was hard to switch off from work and focus on myself. However, my diagnosis was also a real eye-opener. Every face tells a story. My story is one of many, and if it encourages other guys to go and get checked, even better… Three seconds saved my life. It’s so important to be able to speak openly about it, and discuss it.

How Pat Shortt made a comedy about emigration and 1916,"YOU KNOW WHO Pat Shortt is.

He’s Tom from Father Ted, one half of D’Unbelievables and the star of Killinaskully.

He’s also a film actor, comedian and chart-topping singer.

But what he represents is a quintessentially Irish brand of humour and satire. He is the Irishman’s Irishman.

Shortt’s new film The Flag, which was released in cinemas on Friday, tells a very Irish story which weaves emigration, Irish identity and 1916 together in a caper comedy.

Shortt plays Harry Hambridge, a man from a small town now living in London. After coming home for his finds out that not only did his grandfather raise the Irish flag above the GPO, but the British are keeping it in an army barracks.

With a fill of porter, Harry decides he’s getting it back and a heist plan is put in place.

While the film takes plenty of shots at the British establishment, it is essentially an examination of Irishness, something Shortt has also been seen doing on the small screen in TV3′s excellent Small Town.

Sitting in a Dublin hotel, Shortt says that the comedy can easily be used to pose questions.

“When you play Irish characters, even from a comic point of view, you have to analyse them and think about them and the impact different things have had.

“(You have to think about) how they react to it, whether it’s religion, religion, whatever or in the case of The Flag that pride in being Irish.”

The Flag’s closing scenes see Harry at this year’s 1916 commemorations asking about Ireland as a nation – where we are and whether we actually honour the ideals of the 1916 dead.

“It’s a great part of the movie.

“I think it’s a great thing in a comedy – that you can be serious about ourselves and look at ourselves.”

Our world

Looking at Irish people is something Shortt has plenty of experience with.

But he says that the Irishness of his output is rooted in an affection for Irish life – and the confidence we have in ourselves.

“For a very small nation of people, our large world is the little world around us.

“So the guy who’s living in a rural village in Ireland – his world is as important as London or New York. And I think that’s a great confidence thing.

“That innocent kind of look at the world.”

He says his own character in the film – complete with Italia 90 jersey and Irish vinyl – “is in London, but may as well be in Ireland”.

And what’s next for him?

“I don’t want to do anything only keep working,” he laughs.

“I have a new live show that I’m looking forward to touring around the country with and taking to America and Australia.”

Indeed, Shortt’s popularity abroad shows that Irishness doesn’t end at the borders.

This Irish doll-maker has signed a book deal with famed children's publisher Penguin,"IRISH DOLL-MAKER Arklu has signed a publishing deal with children’s books giant Penguin, which has worked with authors such as famed novelist Roald Dahl.

The Donegal-based firm created Lottie in 2012, a doll that was intended to look and take part in activities like a real child.

Since its launch, the doll has grown in popularity, selling more than half a million figurines and accessories, and is now set to be the subject of several Penguin books.

The two companies have agreed a three-year publishing contract. The first books to be released under the partnership are due to launch in May 2017.

The company said that the books will be an extension of the ‘Lottie, Finn and friends collection’, and will follow the adventures of three nine-year old friends as they navigate family, friendship and childhood.

Launch

Two books will be published, one a fiction title for young readers, and one a sticker dressing-up book, which will be focused on stargazing and space.

A further two titles, one fiction and one activity book, will then follow in September 2017.

The books will be part of Penguin’s Puffin collection for children. Penguin has worked with several of the best-known children’s authors including Roald Dahl, whose books include The BFG and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Jeff Kinney, who wrote Diary of a Wimpy Kid.

A spokeswoman for Arklu said that final details of the launch, such as how many shops the books will be available in, are still under discussion.

However, she added: “It is an international contract. The dolls are sold in 30 countries and we would hope that the books will follow suit.”

Arklu managing director Ian Harkin said that following the deal the firm will be “introducing almost 20 new products in 2017 including playsets, storage units, playmats and buildings for the first time”.

“Being based on a child is what makes Lottie and Finn unique, taking kids on adventures as opposed to performing adult activities or careers. The books complement this – like Lottie they will be real characters just like the kids themselves.”

Startup winner

Leanne Gill, the publisher of licensed properties at Penguin Random House Children’s, said that the company is “delighted to be the publishing partner for Lottie Dolls”.

Arklu was also recently selected by Google as the winner of its latest Adopt a Startup programme for Ireland - a prize which includes thousands of euro in free credit for the tech giant’s services.

Speaking at the time, Harkin told Fora the company also has plans to unveil an app, which was part of work it did with Google.

New Yorkers are leaving each other loving post-it notes to support each other after the election,"NEW YORKERS STRUGGLING with post-election stress have found an outlet for the blues, by pouring their political souls onto sticky notes that fill walls of a Manhattan subway station.

In the days after Republican Donald Trump won the White House, Democrat Hillary Clinton’s loss brought many of her New York supporters to tears — even in public.

Enter 28-year-old Brooklyn artist Matthew Chavez, known as Levee. He set up a table in a long tunnel of the Union Square station where he hands out the blank pastel notes on which straphangers scribble.

He calls this “Subway Therapy.” It’s free.

More than 1,500 people have shared their grief and anxiety since Wednesday, posting thoughts on the white subway tiles.

The uplifting art installation counterbalances what Clinton supporters say is Trump’s racism, bigotry and ignorance.

One note reads, “You will not divide us. Love is everything.” Another says,

It doesn’t end today.

One says: “If they go low, we go high,” echoing first lady Michelle Obama.

Another sticky note offers soothing words, saying, “Everything will be alright.” But a few feet over, another person wasn’t so sure: “What do we do now?”

There was an answer amid the sea of impromptu messages.

New cocktail of drugs could significantly improve outcomes for cancer patients,"A NEW COMBINATION of two drugs could extend the lives of thousands of people with kidney cancer.

Scientists say 40% of kidney cancer patients using the combined drugs saw their tumours significantly reduce in size, while 10% were left with “no detectable sign of cancer” at all.

The two drugs, ipilimumab and nivolumab, work by stimulating the body’s own immune system to fight the cancer.

The study evaluated the drugs, at different doses, in previously-treated and treatment-naïve patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

Renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer, accounting for approximately nine out of ten cases.

The overall response rate, the number of patients who saw a complete or partial reduction in their tumours, was 40%.

One in 10 patients treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every three weeks for four cycles, followed by nivolumab 3mg/kg every two weeks, achieved a complete response, where no detectable sign of cancer remained.

These investigational data were presented during the 2016 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO).

Dr Conleth Murphy, Consultant Medical Oncologist, Bon Secours Hospital, Cork said, “It is very promising to see these early results as they demonstrate that using two immunotherapy agents in combination has the potential to significantly improve outcomes for patients with advanced kidney cancer.

The degree of tumour shrinkage seen with combined therapy is particularly encouraging.

“The experience we have had with nivolumab in Irish patients with kidney cancer has been very impressive so I am hopeful that today’s data regarding the nivolumab + ipilimumab combination may further improve outcomes in the coming years.”

Each year, roughly 570 people are diagnosed with kidney cancer in Ireland and in the last 40 years the number of cases has doubled in men, and risen by 130% in women.

Approximately 254 people die from kidney cancer every year in Ireland. In cases of late-stage kidney cancer, it is estimated that only one in 10 patients will survive for five years or more in Ireland.",https://www.thejournal.ie/cancer-drugs-outcomes-3017860-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
Here are some handy iPhone and Android gestures you might not know about,"AT THIS POINT, all of us know the basic swipe and tap gestures needed to use and navigate our smartphones.

But beyond that, there are a whole host of other gestures and ideas that you might not be familiar with. Some are specific to apps themselves while others can be used across the board.

Here are a few to get you started.

All (iOS and Android)

- Both iOS and Android have a zoom-in option available to users. Going into Settings (> General) > Accessibility > Zoom/Magnification Gestures to activate it. Depending on which one you use, it’s activated by tapping the screen three times with one finger, or double-tap with three fingers.

- On Google Maps, if you double-tap on the screen, you zoom in. However, what you might not know is if you continue holding down after the second tap, you can continue zooming in and out by swiping your finger up and down.

- When you’re typing, holding down on a specific key will bring up alternative characters (For example, holding down ‘i’ will bring up extra characters like ‘í’).

- On Snapchat, if you’re recording a video, you can zoom in and out by swiping up and down.

- On Apple and Google Photos, you can select multiple photos by pressing select/holding down on one photo and dragging your finger over them. Handy if you need to bulk-delete photos.

iOS

- If you own an iPhone 6s or 7, force pressing the spacebar when typing lets you move it around. Easier than trying to tap or drag the pointer around.

- When you’re in an app, you can go back one screen by swiping right.

"Dublin before the internet: weight gain pills, big hair and swimming pools in nightclubs","A NEW EXHIBITION in Dublin aims to bring visitors back to Ireland pre-internet, where women avoided being called skinny and Terry Wogan was a voice on pirate radio.

Brian ‘Doug’ McMahon’s site Brand New Retro, has scanned and digitised images from Irish magazines that have never been put on the internet before.

After online success and a book, McMahon has moved on to a museum exhibition which opened in the Little Museum of Dublin this week.

Speaking to TheJournal.ie he says he is “delighted” with the end result, which brings together his love of retro pop with a snapshot of what Ireland was like in the 60s and 70s.

“I’m delighted with it. It feels like it came together at the last minute, but It is exactly what I wanted as a medium for showing the collection.

“I think it’s different, it’s an explosion of colour and information.”

Source: Brand New Retro

Be it a retro jukebox playing McMahon’s own 45s, early magazine interviews with Anne Doyle or information on Ireland’s first gay nightclub, the exhibition gives either a nostalgic blast from the past or an insight into an Ireland many of us haven’t seen.

And it is all sourced from McMahon’s own collection.

I grew up loving pop and when punk came around, me and my brother started a fanzine, which gave me an appreciation of what went into making magazines, so I rarely threw them away. So a built up a collection from there.

“When I started the blog, it was to put up stuff I had done or was interested in that wasn’t on the internet.

“And I found there was a load of Irish stuff that wasn’t on the internet.”

Source: Brand New Retro

McMahon’s collection now includes thousands of magazines from the 60s, 70s and 80s, but he still has a soft spot for certain things.

“I like something that has a geographical reference and is of its time.”

He points to the exhibition’s main image, of Miss Ireland 1965 Gladys Waller sitting on a Morris Minor on the bridge to Bull Island in 1966 wearing clothes from Brown Thomas .

“I get a great satisfaction out of the rejuvenation of things like that.

I love that people will see things for the first time. There’s something for everyone. I like that it’s interactive as well, that’s the experience.”

The exhibit runs in the Little Museum of Dublin until January.",https://www.thejournal.ie/brand-new-retro-exhibit-3014456-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
Meet the man who's helping Irish children embrace their artistic sides,"PJ Lynch with costume designer Joan Bergin (left) Source: Sasko Lazarov/Photocall Ireland

WHEN YOU’RE A child, reading and drawing can fit so easily into your creative world – if you’re lucky enough to be introduced to them.

As Laureate na Nóg, the children’s laureate, artist PJ Lynch could be just the man to introduce a whole new generation to the joy of art and reading.

One of the country’s most impressive and lauded illustrators, he has been awarded the Christopher Medal three times and been given the Kate Greenaway Medal on two occasions for his work on children’s books.

The Belfast native has been drawing from a young age, and managed to make illustration a career as well as a personal passion. It took him 30 years, but he’s even written his own book, The Boy Who Fell Off the Mayflower.

He’s has also collaborated with Ryan Tubridy on a forthcoming book called Patrick and the President which Tubridy has written and Lynch has illustrated.

“It was an honour”

For Lynch, taking on the role of laureate means spreading the word about art and literature to young people around Ireland. It’s not a role he takes lightly.

“It was a huge honour,” he says of the laureateship (the role was created in 2010). “It was mind blowing – the biggest honour of my career.”

He was particularly chuffed to be following in the footsteps of the previous laureates, Eoin Colfer, Siobhán Parkinson and Niamh Sharkey.

“Eoin was a storyteller and his laureateship was very much to do with stories – I love stories but I’m artists and for me it’s got to be about making pictures,” he says of his intentions with the two-year role.

Lynch is almost evangelical about how children can benefit from reading. “It’s really important, because I think whenever children read books it’s a way for them to slip into someone else’s situation, it’s a way for them to understand other people’s problems.”

“It helps people empathise,”he says. “Reading is absolutely vital for our development as human beings. It’s important.”

It’s interesting, then, that he admits that as a small child: “I did love reading but I didn’t read enough.” It wasn’t until he hit college that he got the reading bug.

Lynch knows the importance of being inspired by other people. ”I remember back when I was little when I used to watch artists drawing, I was so fascinated to see people drawing,” he recalls, calling the process “really magical”.

“I want to share that process,” he explains. Part of that involves creating a video podcast series called The Big Picture, where he meets with artists and illustrators and gets them to talk about their work – people like Oliver Jeffers and Chris Judge.

So I want to cover the whole range of drawing and I want to show how people draw and I want kids to get in and say ‘wow, I love that drawing and I want to give it a go’.

“Art was my thing”

Lynch, who has illustrated over 20 books, was the kid in the class who was always scribbling and sketching. “I think it was the thing I was best at in school, it was the thing I absolutely loved.

“You know you get a kid in the class who is the artist or the musician – I was the artist and it was my thing, but I was always going to do something arty. In my family or my school I don’t think anyone had gone to art college. I was breaking new ground.”

But he got “huge support” from his parents – “at a time when other people might have said ‘go out and get a proper job’”.

Lynch went to college in Brighton, where one of his tutors was the man behind The Snowman, Raymond Briggs.

“He was getting really successful – he inspired a lot of us,” Lynch recalls. “Living in England made it easy to get to London and make contacts with publishers. These days I think you can live anywhere and I think you can communicate through the internet.”

It’s a far cry from when he used to fax in illustration ideas to people.

What’s a typical day for Lynch? When we speak, he’s preparing to give a talk to some school children in Cork and do some drawing with them, as part of his laureateship.

“Typically I get to do a bit of work in the studio,” he adds, though he loves the new opportunities the laureateship offers.

I do try to work 9 – 5 and if I have a tight deadline I can really push the work out. Usually I get a year for a book. At the start I spend a lot of time reading and researching, probably dawdling. And towards the end I really work hard and fast. It depends on where I am in the project.

Since he has become more established, he’s also gotten to take part in large projects like a huge mosaic he worked on in Knock. It’s the height of a five-storey building.

“I’m hoping I will get the chance to do a big picture [like that] in Ireland [as part of the laureateship],” he says. “I really want that image to be a testament to the whole idea of the imagination and children’s literature. I have a few sites in mind.”

Want a career in art?

If you are a young person who’s thinking of a career as an illustrator, Lynch has advice for you.

“I would say it’s one of those jobs that you can do an awful lot by yourself at home, but I don’t want to just encourage people to do that. If you are a certain age you can go to art college and find a certain college that specialises in illustration. Some of the colleges here are pretty good on illustration as well. It’s one of those jobs that you don’t have to get the qualification before you get a go at it.”

He advises to keep practicing and studying – and even try and make your own dummy illustrated book that you can send off to publishers, and make sure you get feedback on your work.

“If you’ve got an idea there’s nothing stopping you,” he says. “It is a brilliant job for anyone who’s interested in art.”

PJ Lynch will officially open the 20th Baboró International Arts Festival for Children which runs in Galway from October 17 – 23. On Monday 17 October, Lynch will take part in a panel discussion with fellow artists Tarsila Krüse and Shona Shirley Macdonald, chaired by Alan Clarke, about their careers as illustrators.

Stolen dog reunited with owner after being found on sale at a fair,"Joey the cavachon dog is reunited with his brother and owner Source: ISPCA

THIS IS THE emotional reunion of Joey the dog with his owner and brother Toby.

Joey, who is a Cavachon breed, went missing near his home on 3 October and, by Saturday, he was being offered for sale at the Ballinasloe Fair.

Suspicions were raised by members of the public and an ISPCA inspector scanned the dog.

Joey was microchipped so the ISPCA was able to track down the owner and reunite them.

Joey and Toby are now back together. Source: ISPCA

Investigation

The dog was taken into the care of the ISPCA and gardaí are now investigating the matter.

ISPCA chief inspector Conor Dowling said: “This is further evidence, if it was needed, of the value of microchipping.

Without Joey’s microchip, we could not have established that he was missing and the ISPCA and gardaí would not have had grounds to intervene.

The ISPCA had four inspectors present on the three busiest days of this year’s Ballinasloe Fair.

In addition to Joey, inspectors seized a further 27 dogs and three horses.

#Open journalism No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you Support us now

For ISPCA inspectors to seize animals, they must have grounds to believe that offences under the Animal Health and Welfare Act have been committed.

Demand

ISPCA CEO Dr Andrew Kelly highlighted the fact that the sale of dogs and other small animals at fairs is driven by demand and that, if people did not buy these animals, then they wouldn’t be offered for sale.

He said: “This year in Ballinasloe we were made aware of a number of rescue organisations that were buying animals in order to ‘rescue’ them instead of raising their concerns with the ISPCA or An Garda Síochána.”

“Whilst buying animals may be very tempting, it is the opinion of the ISPCA that it simply perpetuates the problem and the sellers will be back in future years with more animals to sell.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/stolen-dog-reunited-ballinasloe-3023256-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
Michelin star-winning Dublin restaurant booked out until next Autumn,"A DUBLIN RESTAURANT which scooped a Michelin star is booked out until August 2017 after a massive surge in demand.

Heron and Grey, which is located in Blackrock, south Dublin, has no tables left until next year since news of its win last week.

The team will start taking new bookings in the spring.

Damien Grey, one half of the team who set up the eatery, revealed the news this morning.

Whoops! We couldn't find this Tweet

We interviewed Rebecca Burr, editor of the Michelin Guide and she told TheJournal.ie that its work is not cut and dried.

We tend to hear that restaurants have phones ringing off the hook, but many already had very busy restaurants before that. Heron and Grey for example, is already very successful, we just came along and added what we thought.

“There’s no such thing as a typical Michelin-starred restaurant. I think that’s what makes the stars interesting.”

The addition of Heron & Grey to the guide last week increases to 10 the overall number of Michelin star restaurants in the Republic of Ireland.

Celine Dion sends best wishes as Pat Kenny picks up IFTA Lifetime Achievement gong,"PAT KENNY PICKED up a Lifetime Achievement award and TV3′s Red Rock was among the big winners as the IFTA TV awards took place last night at the DoubleTree Hotel on Dublin’s Upper Leeson Street.

In what was perhaps an unexpected move, the video package played in advance of Kenny’s acceptance speech included a greeting from singer Celine Dion.

The Canadian star’s inclusion makes a little more sense if you take into account that Dion won the Eurovision back in 1988 (for Switzerland), when Kenny co-presented the contest from the RDS.

"Mattress Mick's guide to life: ""Believe in yourself","THE CHARACTER OF Mattress Mick is big, brash and bold – a bit quirky, a bit odd, and always guaranteed to put a smile on your face.

But behind the character are two men: the real Mick, Michael Flynn:

Michael Flynn Source: YouTube

And Paul Kelly, the guy who has helped create Mattress Mick and turn him into an online phenomenon.

Paul Kelly Source: YouTube

The relationship between the two men and their journey to nationwide fame is explored in a new documentary, Mattress Men, which doesn’t shy away from showing viewers the tough times the pair have had.

When TheJournal.ie goes to catch up with Flynn and Kelly in Mattress Mick’s Pearse St store, the back room of which has been turned into a studio for the occasion, the first thing we do is plop ourselves down on a nearby mattress.

It’s certainly the most comfortable wait we’ve had for an interview, while the shop, like Mattress Mick, is bright, flashy, but also familiar.

It does what it says on the tin – it’s not promising you anything more than you need. Indeed, Flynn (who comes from a family with a retail background) owned general furniture shops prior to the recession, but changed his focus to just the one product: mattresses.

Both Flynn and Kelly are all about focus. And they’re two men who know about surviving the rough times. Their work together has helped them both grow.

The documentary was meant to be a 10-minute film, but “it took its own legs, basically”, says Flynn. That’s in part because they became better known, with Flynn being invited to turn up in character at a range of events, his fluffy white hair and large glasses – as well as that toothy grin – becoming his trademark.

Source: YouTube

“I was going to be completely honest”

Flynn says he didn’t find the process intrusive – but it’s a documentary that shows some of the rougher moments for himself and Kelly.

“Now, there were some situations filmed that I would have liked to have been a little bit more private but they were there and [director] Colm [Quinn] did a good job in portraying them,” says Flynn.

“Well, I found it strange to be in front of the camera rather than behind the camera,” says Kelly, for whom the process was a life-changing experience. When Quinn approached him to make the film, he was in debt, unemployed, and not living with his children. “My life was completely downhill,” he says now. The documentary follows as he attempts to turn Mick Flynn into a star, and tries to turn his own life around in the process.

When he agreed to star in Mattress Men, he was going to be frank about what he was going through.

I was going to be completely honest and open because there are a lot of people in the same situation as I am… I could easily give up, claim the social welfare and not do anything with my life, but I felt I was better than that and my story should be told, so it had to be completely 100% open in every circumstances and every situation within this film because that’s life, and this story really shows them hard times.

Being Mattress Mick

Because Mattress Mick is such a character, it’s tempting to think the man behind him is too.

But Flynn is, above all, and as the documentary shows, a businessman. He’s been through hard times – he’s felt the impact of the recession on his life and pocket. He’s had to make difficult decisions and reinvent himself.

Though he and Kelly’s situations were different in some ways, at the heart they tell the same story of overcoming the odds.

“I don’t think people would realise that I had the problems that I had, the financial problems and so forth,” says Flynn.

“We’ll all find we had problems somewhere along the line and I opened up my problems to the world by saying I had problems and I think… they’ll see me just as a normal guy trying to sell mattresses, and more mattresses, and more mattresses.”

I would consider myself a serious businessman. I got into bother when the recession hit, things went wrong but I had to get going again, I had to survive and I had to prove myself to myself as well as to the people who would have known me.

His hope is that the film shows the darkness. “I hope that it encourages other people who may have been in the same situation as we were not to give up, to move on and to fight and to believe in yourself, that is the most important that to believe – that you are capable of getting back up there, getting on top of your troubles and problems, do not let anyone interfere with you, just be totally focused on your own goals.

“And that’s what I did, and Paul is also doing the same,” assures Flynn, that grin replaced with a look of steely determination.

Source: YouTube

Thinking positively

For Kelly, the whole process has been a spiritual journey, he tells me. “And I know some people may think it’s crazy,” he smiles. “But I had absolutely nothing and I was nowhere and I started reading positive books about visualising and setting yourself goals, the laws of the universe. And once I started believing in that, things started happening.”

He believes the pair were fated to work together, telling me that he used to pass Michael Flynn outside his Pearse St shop when he worked nearby 20 years ago.

“I used to remember thinking to myself ‘one day I’d like to be my own businessman and be that happy in my business’,” he recalls.

And in time, Kelly was able to set up his own company, Shoot Audition – which provides an online platform for actors’ auditions – and Flynn was able to help him with office space and a way of making money.

It’s paying off – Flynn says their business is getting stronger and they’re “very pleased” with how the film turned out.

“It’s different, it’s quirky and it’s fun, but we couldn’t have done it, I couldn’t have done it on my own, Paul couldn’t have done it on his own, he needed a Mattress Mick and I needed a Paul, and it worked together.”

Any bad times, they “overcame them because we both believe in our own destinies and we both believe we can get back on top again”.

“He gives me something back”

The pair’s relationship began in the most Irish of ways – in a pub. They met in Flynn’s regular drinking hole, The Yacht.

“He was at a bad place in his business so we were meant to meet and do what we did together,” says Kelly now.

“I would have had nothing: no business, no nothing if it wasn’t for Mick giving me the room space to grow and learn.”

He learned how to make the zany, effects-crammed Mattress Mick videos through YouTube tutorials.

In turn, Flynn has learned from him. “I couldn’t have done it without Paul because I knew nothing about social media and I was used to advertising, for example, in newspapers. Like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter were all names that I knew but didn’t understand and Paul brought that into my life, and that’s how I think we work well together,” says Flynn, looking at his friend.

“I can give him something, and he gives me something back.”

What’s their life philosophy?

Paul:

My one would be: The greatest souls are awakened out of suffering – the most impressive personalities endure many scars.

Mick:

I can’t beat that one.",https://www.thejournal.ie/mattress-mick-film-interview-3009241-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
Dublin's Smithfield will be chockablock for the Busker Fleadh tomorrow,"Buskers Sam Brittain and Meg LaGrande at the launch of the Fleadh Source: Jason Clarke Photography

IF YOU’RE KICKING your heels for something to do in Dublin tomorrow you could do a lot worse than checking out the city’s first Busker Fleadh.

Street performance is something that Dublin is pretty much synonymous with, and the Fleadh, which will run in conjunction with the Smithfield Stoneybatter Food Festival, is set to showcase the best of it, in the organisers’ own words.

The Fleadh is being brought to us by Dublin City Council (DCC), with Lord Mayor Brendan Carr saying the event will bring us the best of the city’s “vibrant music scene”.

Apart from bringing the cream of Ireland’s buskers together for a few short hours at Smithfield Square (the Fleadh kicks off at 12 noon and quits at 5pm), there will be quite a deal of other stuff to contend with.

“There’ll be lots of food stalls and the High Hopes Choir will be on the scene as well,” says Fleadh organiser Kathryn Byrne.

Street performers from the Dublin Circus Project will be on hand, there’ll be a special screening of Irish comedy-drama Sing Street in the Lighthouse Cinema, and the whole thing will be topped off with the Dublin Busker Competition.

Come and see the talented Charleen Murphy at the #BuskerFleadh from 12pm Sunday https://t.co/MpXRpMoDGL — BuskerFleadh (@BuskerFleadh) October 5, 2016 Source: BuskerFleadh /Twitter

So there’s something in it for everyone.

The winner(s) of the Busker Competition will be gifted recording time at Windmill Lane Recording Studios and a digital download of their recordings worth €1,000.

20 acts came through an open call to perform at the event, which will see four running through their sets each hour around the square. One of those is Wexford two-handers The Scenarios, made up of Thomas Furlong and William Carley.

“We formed about a year and a half ago while we were both up in St Pat’s,” the pair told TheJournal.ie. “We started practicing together to try and raise money for a charity skydive – that went well so we stuck with it.”

The two are an acoustic band, with both providing vocals, guitars, and, less expectedly, a ukulele. They picked up on a Facebook ad for the Fleadh a couple of months ago, just a number of weeks after they started gigging seriously.

The Scenarios

“We hope we’re in with a shout anyway,” Thomas says of the Busker Competition.

We played a wedding last night, but we’ll be up fresh and early for the contest, and we’ll give it our best.

Everyone seems to be very excited for the event in truth, with Kathryn Byrne affirming that all those involved can’t wait for it to begin.

“We’re bursting with excitement for this, we’ve been talking about this for two years and now it’s time to go,” she says.",https://www.thejournal.ie/busker-fleadh-2016-smithfield-3013150-Oct2016/,the_journal,1

There's a new online tool to help house buyers compare prices,"Source: Eamonn Farrell/Rollingnews.ie

THE CENTRAL STATISTICS Office (CSO) has today launched a new online tool to aid house buyers across the country.

The interactive portal, catchily-titled ‘House Prices by Eircode’ takes your Eircode routing key (the first three characters of whatever code) and throws back price information for the area in question.

It’s very user-friendly, although more digging will be required if you’re searching for specific information.

You’ll need to know your Eircode (which, let’s face it, you don’t), but a link to the online code finder is included. Alternatively, you can use the name of the area, but we found it quicker to search for the Eircode and then use that.

The information revealed isn't necessarily happy information unfortunately Source: CSO

Click here to view a larger image

The tool will tell you the average price of property in the area over the last 12 months (up to July 2016), together with comparisons between that asking price and the national average, and the contrast between new builds, second-hand, and unoccupied homes changing hands.

The volume of sales in the area for the last six years is also returned.

The blurb for the new option states that it is designed to work in conjunction with the Residential Property Price Register. Also, it says it “harnesses the power of Eircodes”. Which is nice.

Evaluation? It’s quite slick and very worthwhile for a quick check, but given no drilldown detail is given on the types of home being talked about or the specific areas in which they fall, it’s probably best utilised as a starting point for buyers only.

It’s still pretty handy though. Check it out here.",https://www.thejournal.ie/cso-buyers-tool-online-3026448-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
"Dublin manager Jim Gavin plays ""groomsman"" to 5,300 animals being airlifted to Africa","Source: Diarmuid Greene/True Media

NOT CONTENT WITH managing the most dominant team in recent Gaelic Football history, Dublin manager Jim Gavin has taken charge of an altogether different kind of team bus.

Gavin, a commercial pilot and director with the Irish Aviation Authority when he’s not winning All Irelands, has served as one of two “groomsmen” to 5,300 animals that have been airlifted to Rwanda, Africa, on a flight from Shannon Airport where the beasts will serve as food and income producers for that country’s farmers.

The cargo included 37 pregnant heifers, three bulls, 260 pigs, and 5,000 chickens, all bound for Rwanda on a flight known as the Bóthar Ark, named for the Irish international aid agency who chartered the plane.

“Behind the excitement behind this trip is immense generosity, great organisation and, at the end of the line, great hope,” Gavin said before embarking on the historic flight.

Upon arriving in Rwanda, the animals (the majority donated by Irish farmers, and up to six times more productive than the local Rwandan livestock) will be placed in quarantine to adjust to their new environment before being delivered to their recipient families.

Gavin himself first made contact with Bóthar with regard to being involved with the airlift – the 25th that the aid agency has undertaken.

“Winning the All-Ireland is, of course, a privilege but this is also,” says Gavin.

To be able to witness first-hand the transformation of the lives of some of the poorest people in the world is definitely a privilege.

An Apple-affiliated company is bringing 134 jobs to Limerick,"A TEXAS-BASED company that specialises in providing support to companies that use Apple devices is to create 134 jobs in Limerick.

The jobs at Trusource Labs will come on stream over the next three years as the company sets up a new international operations centre in the south-west.

In providing support for corporate Apple users, Trusource Labs is a member of the Apple Consultants Network and employs 600 people in the US.

The company has yet to give details about the type of jobs on offer but its co-founder Alton Martin said this morning that they will be related to “customer experience”.

“We are enthusiastic to bring our innovative customer experience model to Ireland. It is our first step in a larger global growth plan and we are grateful for IDA’s partnership and support,” he said.

As Martin mentions, the jobs were supported by the IDA, with CEO Martin Shanahan describing Trusource’s decision to go to Limerick as “a valuable reference case for IDA in attracting similar high growth technology companies to the region.”

Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Mary Mitchell O’Connor also said that the decision of the country to set up in Limerick demonstrated the government’s commitment to “job creation right across the country.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/jobs-limerick-5-3018435-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
Your iPhone now has a hidden magnifying mode that you can use,"THE LATEST UPDATE to iOS brought a number of improvements to the formula, including one of the best parts of Apple’s software: Accessibility.

Alongside the usual options of reading out text and improving contrast, the latest version comes with a magnifier option which you can access in Accessibility.

To find it, go into Settings > General > Accessibility > Magnifier and turn it on. You also have the option of switching on auto-brightness too but it’s not necessary.

Once that’s done, triple-click the home button and you will see the magnifier option appear. Tap on it and you will go into a camera mode that’s zoomed in somewhat.

For those wondering why they couldn’t just use the camera instead, the answer is the different accessibility filters it uses.

While you can zoom in or out, you can adjust the brightness and contrast and use different filters which include white/blue, greyscale, and red/black. You can even invert the colours if you want.

And then there’s the shutter button which lets you avoid holding the phone for long periods. When you press it, you take a temporary photo of whatever is in front of you. From that you can move around or zoom out if necessary.",https://www.thejournal.ie/ios-magnifier-mode-2987419-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
"Thousands of nurses to see pay rise of at least €1,000 next year","Nurses take part in a pay restoration protest at Leinster House last month.

Nurses take part in a pay restoration protest at Leinster House last month.

UP TO 7,500 nurses and midwives will see an extra €1,000 in next year’s total pay as certain increments are to be restored from 1 January 2017.

Health Minister Simon Harris announced today that nurses who graduated between 2011 and 2015 will have their incremental credit for their 36-week student placement restored.

The move has been welcomed by nurses and unions.

Speaking about the decision, Harris said it was clear to him that the issue was “severely impacting on conditions and morale”.

The Wicklow TD hopes that the pay rise will encourage Irish nurses working abroad to return home.

“We have major challenges recruiting and retaining nurses in this country but I believe this is a small step forward. We need our nurses to stay and we need our nurses to come home,” he said in a statement.

“This decision comes at the end of a long campaign to end this pay injustice and the two tier pay system that had developed and was having a detrimental effect on recruiting and retaining nurses,” added SIPTU organiser John McCamley.

“This is a small step in recognising the vital contribution that these nurses have made to our public health service.”

The INMO says that the pay rise could be up to €1,500 for some of its members.

The union said the “removal of this anomaly involving the withholding of incremental credit for the fourth year of the undergraduate programme, sees the elimination of this very regressive measure which was introduced, unilaterally, in 2011″.

What can Ireland's cities learn from the Night Mayor of Amsterdam?,"IT CAN’T ALL be down to the eye-catching job title.

Paris, Toulouse and a raft of other cities across The Netherlands have adopted the idea of appointing a night mayor, following the success of Amsterdam’s ‘nighttime czar’.

London’s even following suit: new mayor Sadiq Khan recently published a job ad seeking someone to boost nightlife culture and promote the clubbing economy. And earlier this year, a panel debate took place in Dublin to discuss whether Ireland’s capital could benefit from the appointment of an official to look after the city, after dark.

So what does a night mayor actually do?

And how would the residents of Ireland’s cities stand to benefit, if the scheme was introduced in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere?

Source: Mirik Milan

Meet the Night Mayor

Mirik Milan, the current Night Mayor of Amsterdam (and the first person to hold that title anywhere, to our knowledge) will be speaking at a conference in the Docklands area of Dublin this week. Highlighting the positives of nighttime culture is a key part of his role, he said in a phone interview with TheJournal.ie.

Changing the narrative of nightlife is really important: people can benefit from it and they don’t have to feel like they’re doing something wrong to be involved in this industry.

Milan, a former club promoter, was appointed to the role in 2012, he explained. It had existed for around a decade before then, but was more of a nominal position - ”something you’d get as a nightlife person to raise your profile and to be cool”.

He created a small non-profit organisation partly funded by the city in 2014. With support from bars and clubs, has been working since then to improve life after dark for businesses and their customers – acting as a bridge between the nightlife world and Amsterdam’s residents and officials.

But the focus isn’t on dealing with individual complaints from club-owners or residents, Milan explained.

“We focus on legislation – what’s going on in the city, how we can get all the stakeholders together.

I would never just respond to a complaint from one person or respond to a request from a club – maybe if there were three or four nightclubs saying ‘we all have the same problem with this piece of legislation, can we speak to City Hall?’ … Then we make sure that people come to the table – and then hopefully we can change the legislation or make it better for all sides.

There was enthusiasm for the project from the off, he said – which Milan puts down to the “typical pragmatic” approach to life in general in The Netherlands.

24 hour party people

Already, the scheme has brought about some significant changes – not least the introduction of 24-hour licences for a number of venues, so clubbers can enjoy their night and make the journey home at a time of their own choosing.

Said Milan:

“These 24 hour licences are not located in the city centre – they’re located on the outskirts of the city, which can be developed more.

The venues can be open longer so more artists play there, and they are in the international spotlight. They can choose for themselves when to open and close – this also makes sure that people don’t all spill out into the streets at the same time.

All of the above may conjure up images of illegal raves of the kind run in warehouses around suburban Dublin – but the approach, Milan explained, couldn’t be more different. Applicants for the 24-hour licences faced stringent stipulations.

“What was really radical about this is that the licences were not given out on the basis that there was four walls and a roof and a bouncer in front of the door – they were given out on the basis of content.

It was focused on quality – we asked people to send in their pitches with a focus on what we thought was beneficial.

Rather than the straightforward bar-nightclub approach, the 24-hour venues host a range of other events too – including theatre and movie nights.

It’s more about the 24 hour economic system – how to use a building more efficiently rather than just having clubbing seven days in a row.

The experiment has served to breath new life into suburban areas of Amsterdam, and ease pressure on the centre of the city.

Square hosts

Milan’s team, in cooperation with City Hall, has also spearheaded the introduction of ‘square hosts’ – a 20-strong crew of trained social workers who patrol designated areas of the city at weekends, acting as ‘soft enforcement’ personnel.

The hosts get to know their area and the regulars at the various clubs on their beat. Their responsibilities take in everything from giving out information on venues to tourists and other visitors, to stepping in to help curb potential outbreaks of violence.

Describing how it works, Milan said “the police are not so visible any more in the nightlife squares – because it often gives a grim and sometimes oppressive feel to the nightlife area”.

So the police are now in the backstreet areas – the square hosts are on the squares.

It works “like stewards at a football stadium,” he explained. “Because the steward is also your friend and they support your team as well.”

“The role of the square host is to de-escalate the situation if they see a problem – but also to give information about what’s going on in each nightclub and which bars play which kind of music.

“The square hosts know which people are the trouble-makers – and they’re there each weekend, so the trouble-makers know they’re being watched as well because there’s, like, 20 square hosts every Friday and Saturday night, so there’s 20 extra sets of eyes on the streets.

If there’s a big problem, of course, they will inform the police and the police will go straight to it.

‘Not a hedonistic Valhalla’

The myriad responsibilities of the role Milan has carved out for himself take in everything from acting as a spokesperson in the media for his city’s nightlife culture, to heading up awareness campaigns to clarify drug use policies.

On the latter:

“Some people think that The Netherlands are some kind of hedonistic Valhalla where you can do anything you like – that’s not true. You get caught with an illegal substance, you will go home with a criminal record.

It’s the worst way to close off your holiday. Our focus is always on harm reduction and giving out the information people will actually use.

Last orders

Asked about the situation in Irish towns and cities at weekends, where pubs close around midnight and clubs shut their doors (all at once) just a few hours later, he says it can often lead to trouble.

I think it means between 12 and 2, it would be really busy on the street? A lot of problems happen when different groups of people meet each other on the street late at night – so it’s much better to divide these people more over the night.

On a more general point, when it comes to changing licensing or related laws “legislators always think that their piece of legislation is going to create behavioural change – but it’s not”.

Behavioural change comes from subcultures. They will influence mainstream culture so you have to invest in your subcultures and try to get people on board, because legislation has never done that.

Horgan: Five or six LOI players good enough to play for Ireland,"DUNDALK WINGER DARYL Horgan believes that there are”five or six” players in the League of Ireland who would be good enough to play for the Republic of Ireland.

Horgan has been in impressive form for Stephen Kenny’s side this season, starring in the Champions League and Europa League, and chipping in with crucial goals as they compete for SSE Airtricity Premier Division and FAI Cup honours.

There has been a clamour for Martin O’Neill to include the 24-year-old in his Ireland squad and the Boys in Green boss revealed that if Dundalk’s schedule was not so tight, he would be in the panel.

Horgan admitted that it would be “fantastic” to be included, but also stressed that more SSE Airtricity League players have what it takes to compete on the international stage.

“If I can do well in that maybe Martin might decide to bring me into the squad,” Horgan told Newstalk’s ‘Off the Ball‘.

“At this moment in time, I’m not in the squad, but it’d be fantastic for myself and to be honest with you, I think Martin, it’s just not me he’s looking at. I think there’s definitely four or five or six players in the league he could bring in.”

The Galway native added: ”I suppose the school of thought was you have to be away [in Britain], but maybe at this stage now, the fact that ourselves and Cork have done well in Europe and proved it against internationals and big players from big countries, [it shows] that maybe there is quality in the league and players are able to make that step up.”

Dundalk’s free-scoring talisman last season, Richie Towell, moved to Championship side Brighton and Hove Albion, but has struggled for game time since making the switch to Britain.

A number of British clubs were also keen on Horgan, but, despite trials with clubs such as Peterborough United and Barnsley, he opted to remain at Oriel Park, where he has since experienced high-level Champions League encounters and is now competing in the Europa League.

“To be honest, it’s probably one of the biggest lessons I could ever have had,” Horgan said, reflecting on his trials in England.

“I’ve got to play constantly here in the first team and in the Europa League and winning leagues. It’s been special the last couple of years.

“I thought they went well, but a couple of weeks after both trials, managers were sacked.

“It’s so cut-throat. You could easily end up signing for a club and the manager could be sacked two days later, another fella might come in and not fancy you, so it was probably a blessing.”

8-week-old puppies seized being exported to Scotland,"TEN PUPPIES WERE seized at a port in Scotland yesterday after being imported illegally and were returned to Belfast.

The pups – five basset hounds and five pug crosses – are all about eight weeks old and are too young to travel.

The dogs were not microchipped and didn’t have pet passports, which are required to travel to the UK.

They were handed over to the care of the ISPCA and are currently receiving veterinary treatment. The pups all appear to be in good health and should be available for rehoming in the coming weeks.

Commenting on the rescue, ISPCA CEO Dr Andrew Kelly said that the attempted exporting of the dogs was “another example of the illegal behaviour of dog breeders in Ireland”.

“Puppies like these are transported at a vulnerable age and many are too young to be separated from their mothers, let alone endure the journey to the UK,” he said.

In addition, all puppies must be microchipped and registered before leaving their place of birth, which these were not. We would also like to appeal to anyone who is looking for a dog to act responsibly and consider adopting from a rescue rather than buying one.

The ISPCA said that the rescue was just one of a number of seizures of puppies at Cairnryan port over the past few months totalling 40.

They were taken as part of Operation Delphin, which is a joint operation targeting the illegal export of puppies from Ireland to the UK.",https://www.thejournal.ie/puppies-seized-3025360-Oct2016/,the_journal,1

Half a century ago Colin saved a girl from drowning; today he wants to find out what happened to her,"The old Bridge at North Beach in Greystones.

The old Bridge at North Beach in Greystones.

This story was updated on 10/10/16

COLIN WILDE SAVED a young girl’s life 50 years ago, but he never learned her name.

In the summer of 1967, when Colin was 12, he travelled from his hometown of Kippax, West Yorkshire, on a school trip to Greystones in Wicklow.

Colin remembers the trip fondly.

On a bright summer’s day, the group headed to nearby Bray to go for a swim. As Colin remembers, the weather was fine but the sea was freezing – too cold to go swimming.

He recalls that after tea at the youth hostel where they were staying, the group had walked down Main Street towards the beach.

“There was a metal bridge over the railway lines to the beach,” Colin told TheJournal.ie over the phone from his home in England.

“I was walking over there and then I just heard this horrible screaming – gurgling screaming,” he said.

“I looked towards the sea and I saw this young girl drowning, no two ways about it she was just drowning.

“So I raced over the bridge to the beach, took my clothes off – luckily I had my swimming trunks on – I swam out and I pulled her back in. I never even thought about it, I just went in and grabbed her arm and got back out. And that’s the last I ever saw of her. Colin Wilde

Memory

Colin never found out the girl’s name or what happened to her after that day.

“Some adults that were there and they turned her on her side and got the sea water out of her lungs,” he said.

The last I saw of her she was getting sick up water on the beach. I just picked my clothes up and went back to the youth hostel.

He remembers that she was fully clothed when he rescued her, wearing a big duffel jacket. He doesn’t know how she got into the water.

He recalls the walk back to the hostel. He was stripped down to his trunks and shivering and an elderly woman brought him back to her house to warm him up with a cup of tea.

When he got back to the hostel, Colin said he was interviewed by a local paper (he can’t remember which paper), and a story appeared the next day about the event.

“I don’t know whether it was the coldness of the water or the shock of what had happened, but I’d lost my voice, I couldn’t even talk,” he said.

“I had a friend with me and he told the newspaper what had happened.

The only way I know she survived is because the newspaper clipping said I had saved her life.

The newspaper in question was the Irish Press. An article that appeared on Saturday, 20 May 1967, detailed Colin’s rescue:

Colin returned to England a few days after the rescue, and his life continued as normal.

Shortly after, he received a certificate from Dublin commending him for saving the girl’s life, which gave her age as 16, but no name.

A report from Tuesday, 12 December mentions Colin again as being awarded a certificate of bravery from Leinster House.

The years passed and Colin grew up, became a sheet metal fabricator by trade and worked most of his life as a site manager.

Today he is retired and living in Kippax, the same small village where he grew up. He is married with three children and two grandchildren.

Recently, when he was telling his grandchildren about the day, he realised that he had lost the newspaper clipping.

“I just don’t know what’s happened to it. I’ve looked everywhere now.”

Appeal

Colin is an avid fisherman. He has returned to Ireland on many occasions over the years on trips and holidays.

“I’ve always had an affinity with Ireland, I can’t really explain it,” he said.

I’ve just always really like it there.

Throughout his life he has often thought of the girl he saved that day in Greystones and what had happened to her.

“I still remember that horrible gurgling sound. The sound of trying to scream but your lungs are full of water… I’ll never forget it,” he said.

“I’ve always wondered what happened to her… what she was doing in the water that day.

I don’t want any adoration or anything I was just curious to know whether she’d had a good life.

An Irish conference for the Snapchat generation has caught the eye of foreign entrepreneurs,"A NEW IRISH ‘wellbeing’ conference for the Snapchat generation has been attracting attention from abroad – before it has even opened its doors for the first time.

The inaugural Zeminar youth summit takes place at the RDS, Dublin from Tuesday to Thursday, and founder Damien Clarke told Fora he has already been approached by social entrepreneurs looking to replicate the event in Australia and Britain.

Around 15,000 young people aged 15 to 20, parents and teachers are expected to attend the conference, where they will learn about issues like mental health and what to do after secondary school.

A number of high-profile people will speak at the event, including musician Bressie, Twitter Ireland boss Mark Little and former Rose of Tralee Maria Walsh.

“The beauty of this event is that it doesn’t need to move around to other cities,” Clarke said. “It can happen simultaneously throughout the world.”

He said that while the response from abroad has been “encouraging”, he wants to “make sure we get our own template right” before selling the concept.

“That might take two years to happen. After that, we will look to see if we can franchise it out to other countries.”

Research

Clarke, a former Web Summit employee with a background in psychology, came up with the idea for Zeminar two years ago.

“I spent a year researching the idea, going to schools, meeting with young people, teachers, parents all over the country and got a sense that there was a demand for a new type of event that covers all of the different interests and issues that young people have.”

He set up a crowdfunding campaign to get the initiative off the ground.

He raised over €15,000 in a Fund It campaign that generated a bit of media attention, which Clarke said “was a nice platform” to attract speakers.

“Once people heard about the event and the impact it’s going to have on young people, they were very supportive,” he said. “People love sharing their stories and want to help young people navigate their way through life.”

Generation Z

The name ‘Zeminar’ is inspired by ‘generation Z’, a term used to describe the strain of millennials that have no memory of life pre-internet.

Companies seem obsessed with getting generation Z’s attention – and money – but it is a notoriously difficult demographic to market to.

In a bid to reach out to a younger audience, the likes of Chartered Accountants Ireland, the Irish Tax Institute and Davy Stockbrokers, hardly mainstays of youth culture, have signed up to showcase their businesses at the event.

Clarke said the event will give the 100 exhibitors “an opportunity to interact with people from a younger age and let them know about the great work they could do if they worked for those organisations”.

“What we’re trying to do is different to Higher Options or Grad Ireland,” he said. “It’s not about just getting a flyer or pen or something like that. It’s really experiential.”

The event will cost around €280,000 to host, according to Clarke.

“As we grow we will spend more on the production of the event each year, so that number will rise.”

Ticket sales have been good, with organisers claiming 12,500 sold at the time of publication. Clarke said he expects to hit the 15,000 mark by Tuesday as interest picks up closer to the event.

Ambitious

Initially, Zeminar expected to attract up to 30,000 attendees, which Clarke acknowledged was too ambitious.

“That was a mistake on our behalf,” he said. “I think when people realise this is our first year and these are the numbers that are coming through, people are going to impressed either way.”

Clarke said he hopes attendees will come away feeling confident and willing to take a “leap of faith” when choosing a profession.

“People are still encouraged to play it safe,” he said. “They’re doing their business or their accounting or their law degrees. They might not be passionate about it, but it’s a safe option.

“This event is about broadening their horizons. You don’t have to go down the old trodden path.”

Housing list families offered chance to build own homes in first-of-its-kind new project,"FIVE FAMILIES WILL be offered the opportunity to build their own homes and boost their employment prospects in the process as part of a groundbreaking new project planned for south Co Dublin.

“We want people to discover their inner builder, and to discover they have these skills,” Niall Martin, one of the organisers of the scheme, told TheJournal.ie.

Interested applicants must be on the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown Council housing list, and willing to put in construction site hours for around a year.

At the end of the process, it’s planned, they’ll own their own home – and they’ll have picked up enough skills to find further employment and help support their families in years to come.

Home Grown Homes

Martin teamed up with two respected architects for the project, known as Home Grown Homes. A site for the five houses, in the Shankill area, has already been identified by the team, and around 100 applications for the housing co-operative have already been received.

An information evening takes place this evening, and Martin said there was still time to apply to be part of the project (you’ll find contact details at the bottom of this article).

“What we’re trying to achieve with the information meeting is to try and shake things out a little bit because it requires an awful lot of commitment to build a house.

It takes an awful lot of work … it takes an awful lot of turning up on time at 8 o’clock in the morning on a building site. We want to make sure people know what’s involved and stick with it.

Source: Home Grown Homes

Habitat for Humanity

Martin, who lives in the Shankill area, came up with the idea while working on a Habitat for Humanity project in Belfast – building homes in a predominantly loyalist area along one of the peace walls.

Along with discovering new skills of his own, he also experienced first hand the positive effect the project had on the community.

It’s absolutely achievable for anyone to be able to pick up a hammer, measure a straight line and help build a house under expert supervision. It’s empowering for people.

As he developed the project, Martin teamed up with Leitrim-based architect Dominic Stevens, who designed and built his own three-bedroom home for around €25,000. Another respected architect, Claire McManus, has come on board as the assigned certifier.

‘I didn’t want charity’

If successful, it’s hoped the scheme can be replicated by other councils around the country as a way to help local families get off housing lists.

Said Martin:

“The whole idea behind this was I didn’t want charity and I didn’t want philanthropy.

I wanted, basically, the cost of this project to be very precise – to be audited so that this could be replicated in another local authority area, where the authority may have small sites that people who are on the housing list could build on.

He’s been amassing building materials for the last number of years – seeking out the best prices on everything from flooring to windows.

“They’re all stacked and ready to go,” he explained. “We’ve kind-of worked backwards to work with the materials that we have and to work them into the scheme in a coherent way so everything looks like a normal estate.”

It’s envisaged that a foreman and project manager will be assigned to the Shankill project via a scheme known as the Local Training Initiative, run by local training board the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB.

And while nothing’s set in stone as yet, the site has already been through a pre-planning process. The design for the house (see above) is also ready to go.

“The land is owned by the local authority,” Martin said.

It’s up to the co-operative members to then negotiate with the council to get that site whether it be on a long term lease or sold over to them.

And there’ll be no financial cost to the families who make up the co-operative until the builds are complete – at which point, it’s planned, mortgages will be arranged. It’s planned that bridging finance will be arranged to cover costs for specialist tradespeople and other outlays, until that point.

The scheme’s quantity surveyor, according to Martin, has told them they can build a unit for €60,000, “and even if that stretches to €80,000 it’s still €100,000 cheaper than can be built anywhere else”.

The reason is that the site will be cheap, there’s a lot of labour cut out because we’re working with volunteers, and also a lot of the materials were acquired at very low prices – so you’re able to build a lot cheaper.

Participants in the scheme will be better candidates for a mortgage as a result of the skills they’ve picked up over their intensive year-long apprenticeship, it’s hoped. The small loan-to-value ratio of their mortgages should make them a reasonable bet too, as far as lenders are concerned.

He explained:

The site will be as much a learning site as much as it is a building site – and those key people, the foreman and the project manager, will be passing on their skills so people are learning along the way.

Ahead of the meeting tonight, Martin’s keen to encourage as diverse a group as possible to apply, stressing that families with disabled members, lone parents and members of minority communities should consider taking part.

A lone mother, for example, who might need to carry out school runs in the morning and early afternoon, could nominate a family member to put in the hours on the site “in that way there could be brothers and sisters and mums and dads participating – and everyone gets a Safe Pass and a manual handling course to allow them to work on the site”.

Martin added that families who took part in the project would have to sign up to stipulations agreeing that the finished house couldn’t be placed onto the open market for a quick profit – however, it’s planned the owners will be allowed to leave the homes to family members in their wills (there’ll be more detail on this at the information meeting).

“It’s absolutely within the power of every local authority to manage a scheme like this if they wish to,” he insisted.

And as for the families selected to take part in the scheme:

It’s empowering. It’s something they can take real pride in.

A burn victim who was told she'd never run again has completed the world's toughest triathlon,"AN AUSTRALIAN WOMAN who was severely disfigured in a bushfire and told she would never run again completed the world’s toughest ironman race over the weekend.

Turia Pitt swam for 3.8km, cycled for 180km and ran for 42km to finish the Hawaii Ironman in a time of 14:37:30.

The gruelling race is seen the toughest of its kind because of the heat and humidity the athletes have to deal with.

Pitt was left with horrific burns to 65% of her body after the bushfire roared through a 100km ultra-marathon event in Western Australia in 2011.

Since then, Pitt spent nearly two-and-half years in hospital and underwent numerous surgeries for her injuries. During that time she was told her running days were over.

“If I finish the race with a smile on my face I’ll say that’s a massive success for me,” she told Sydney’s Ten News before the race.

Finish the race she did, using special clothing to protect her from the harsh elements.

“One of the consequences of being burnt is that my body can’t regulate its temperature as well, so when I get hot I get really hot,” she explained.

Posting to her Facebook page after she completed the challenge, Pitt said that it had been far from easy:",https://www.thejournal.ie/turia-pitt-3018707-Oct2016/,the_journal,1

This company wants to change the entire fashion industry,"FASHION ENTREPRENEUR BERT van Son would love to see Leonardo DiCaprio wearing a pair of his jeans.

“I liked his speech to the UN and I liked his speech when he finally got his Oscar,” van Son tells Fora. “He’s a good ambassador. He’s telling the story we’re trying to tell.”

A high-profile environmentalist, DiCaprio would likely approve of the thinking behind van Son’s sustainable clothing brand, Mud Jeans.

Founded in the Netherlands in 2012, the fashion startup wants to reduce the industry’s enormous manufacturing-generated carbon footprint by giving customers the option to lease – rather than buy – pairs of jeans.

“We try to make it look like a subscription system,” van Son says. “We ask for an entry fee of €20. We take €7.50 from your account each month through PayPal and then after 12 months that stops.”

Customers then have two options: they can keep their jeans or restart their subscription and swap them for a different pair.

“The funny thing is that people really like the idea of being able to switch their jeans after a year.”

Van Son – who will speak at the Community Reuse Network biennial conference in Dublin on Wednesday – says it’s easier to explain the concept using a washing machine – which, evidently, you can lease in the Netherlands.

“For people who don’t have big budgets, they can now afford a fantastic washing machine that is very low on energy and low on water usage,” he says.

“If you look at the total sum that you have to pay monthly, it might be less than when you buy a washing machine that you have to throw away after three, four, five years.”

The principle behind leasing jeans is the same, van Son says. “Do you want to be the owner of something or is the performance good enough?”

Vegan trend

As well as offering the subscription service, Mud Jeans also retails its products – which tick all the eco-warrior boxes, with vegan, organic and chemical-free production. Customers can even get a €10 discount on the €100-odd pricetag if they send back their old pair to be recycled in a factory in Valencia.

A typical Mud Jeans customer is your run-of-the-mill hipster: they are usually aged 25 to 35, well-educated and prefer organic food.

“It’s not 99% of the population, I know, but we are in a growing market.”

Available both online and through retailers in 18 countries, there are no Irish shops stocking the brand yet, but the company is in talks with three major retailers in the UK, which van Son expects will become the startup’s biggest market.

The profit margin for retailers is slimmer because the manufacturing process is more costly, but van Son argues that the more environmentally friendly stone washing method means “we don’t hurt the fabric so our jeans last longer”.

He claims you will never find a pair of his jeans on a sales rack because “we never have overstock”, a major contributor to waste in the often fickle fashion industry.

Sustainable

There was no eureka moment for van Son. Instead, the concept for Mud Jeans evolved over three decades when he first started out in the fashion business.

He launched his career in a textile factory in China, where he was contracted to cut costs and buy as cheaply as possible.

“You make a lot of money,” he says, “but it’s not really fair.”

In 2004, he went on to set up his own company in France, where he was licensed to make apparel for Disney.

“The good thing about working with Disney is that you have a really straightforward code of conduct, which makes you work with good factories,” he says.

“If you have a big brand, you can be a little bit more demanding and work with factories that don’t collapse and where people are given a living wage. That was an eye opener to me. We can do things in a more sustainable way.”

Circular economy

There is a paradigm in the fashion business these days, he says, where consumers still buy on price but are becoming increasingly conscious about where their clothes come from.

“You have the Primarks and the cheap prices and everybody loves it because it so cheap. But then, everybody knows that for a €2 t-shirt, there must be something wrong in the supply (chain) – somebody has been hurt.”

Young parents in particular “don’t want to leave the world behind the way my generation has created it,” van Son says.

“I’m 55 and we’ve been working in a linear economy, which is not a very good idea. We are leaving behind a lot of rubbish. There’s an end to that. In the circular (recycling) economy, if you reuse all the raw materials, you can keep it going for many years.”

Source: Mud Jeans

Van Son’s ultimate goal is to change the fashion industry, which is the second largest polluter in the world, according to Greenpeace.

That said, the most important thing for van Son is to create “a fabulous pair of jeans”. The company expects to double its turnover this year and is close to breaking even after four years in operation.

“It’s all about (sales) volume, that’s the challenge at the moment,” he says. “I can invent any kind of system, but if I don’t have the right product then it’s wasted.”

The company has been gaining ground abroad and there is a celebrity endorsement in the works.

Will we see Leonardo DiCaprio sporting a pair of Mud Jeans any time soon? Probably not, but “we’re on the brink of something spectacular,” van Son promises.

One of the world's top MMA organisations set to bring some big bouts to Dublin,"IRISH MMA FANS will get an early Christmas gift this year, with Bellator and BAMMA set to join forces for a bumper event in Dublin.

Bellator president Scott Coker revealed exclusively to The42 last week that the US-based organisation — the most prominent rival to the UFC — plans to stage a show in Ireland for the first time before the end of 2016.

Irish MMA journalist Peter Carroll has now reported in The Irish Mirror that Bellator will collaborate with British promotion BAMMA to stage two events in one evening at the 3Arena on Friday, 16 December.

It will mark BAMMA’S fourth visit to the venue in the space of 15 months. Most recently, BAMMA 26 took place on 10 September and it was headlined by a successful flyweight title defence for Rany Saadeh against Northern Ireland’s Andy Young.

“It’s going to be a really unique event because fans will be able to come to an arena and see a whole BAMMA card and then after that, they will get a whole Bellator card. It’s basically two shows in one night,” Coker told Carroll.

Bellator 169 in Dublin is to be headlined by a bout between former Strikeforce light-heavyweight champion Muhammed ‘King Mo’ Lawal and Satoshi Ishii, who won a gold medal in judo for Japan at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.

Undefeated SBG prospect James Gallagher is also expected to feature in what will be his second bout for Bellator. The 19-year-old featherweight, who debuted with a unanimous-decision win over Mike Cutting in July, was due to fight at Bellator 164 in Israel next month but he has now been pulled from that card with a view to competing in Dublin instead.

SevereMMA has also reported that several bouts of Irish interest are in the works for the BAMMA 27 portion of the card, including a bantamweight title fight between French star Tom Duquesnoy and Ballymena’s Alan Philpott.

Dublin is home to Europe's fastest-growing major airport,"IT’S WON SOME awards, is getting a new departure hall and possibly even a new terminal. Now, new figures show that Dublin Airport is the fastest growing major airport in Europe.

According to Airports Council International (ACI) Europe, Dublin Airport experienced a 9% increase in passenger numbers in August 2016 compared to the same period last year.

The ACI says that airports in Ireland “experienced very dynamic growth” in the past year. This compares favourably to our continental counterparts, as passenger traffic across the European Airport Network reported an average increase of just 2%.

Terrorism

Terrorism risks and other political factors are a key driver of falling passenger numbers in non-EU countries, as the fallout from the Turkish coup and other instability in the region saw passenger numbers in the country fall almost 15%, while traffic in Russian airports fell 5.5%.

Over 40 people died in the Istanbul-Ataturk Airport terrorist attack in July, and traffic fell significantly at the airport in the ACI figures.

Olivier Jankovec, director general at ACI Europe, warns: “Geopolitical and terrorism risks are increasingly shaping traffic performance for Europe’s Airports.”

“A very strong year”

In the group of airports with more than 25 million passengers a year, Dublin Airport has performed better than Amsterdam Schiphol (+7.9%), Barcelona (+6.8%), Copenhagen (+6.6%) and London Gatwick (+5.7%).

Paul O’Kane, chief communications office for the daa, told TheJournal.ie: “We’re having a very strong year. A combination of 18 new routes, and the expansion of services on 24 routes is helping to drive these passenger increases in what has been a record year for tourism in Ireland.",https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-airport-passenger-increases-3018929-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
A piece of Kim Kardashian's stolen jewellery has been recovered,"Source: Lionel Cironneau

A PIECE OF jewellery stolen from Kim Kardashian during an armed robbery of her Paris apartment last week has been reportedly recovered from a Paris sidewalk.

TMZ reports that a diamond studded cross was apparently dropped by the robbers as they made their getaway.

The gossip site estimates the necklace’s worth at $33,180 (€29,790), which pales in comparison to the value of the overall haul of jewellery stolen which was estimated to be worth in the region of €9 million.

The necklace however is being tested by French police for DNA from the burglars which could be used to catch the culprits, according to TMZ.

35-year-old reality star and businesswoman Kardashian was tied up at gunpoint during the assault which took place just after midnight on Monday 3 October.

Although “badly shaken”, Kardashian was otherwise unharmed.

Police said that five men were involved in the robbery, with two of them entering Kardashian’s bedroom dressed as police officers.

The star, one of the most recognisable of all US celebrities, had made a series of high-profile appearances at Paris Fashion Week.

Immediately upon hearing news of the assault her husband, rapper Kanye West, cancelled a headline show at a New York music festival mid-set.

He has since resumed his American tour. Kardashian herself returned to Los Angeles three days after the robbery.",https://www.thejournal.ie/kardashian-necklace-found-3020069-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
Homeless choir to bring High Hopes to Sligo Choral Festival,"“EVERY SONG TELLS a story,” High Hopes co-ordinator Glenn Alexander says.

“And every single member of the High Hopes Choir has a story to tell – a story that may contain unfathomable loneliness but it also contains courage. It’s also a story that conveys remarkable hope.”

Its members first hit the headlines after an RTE documentary in 2014, and there is more good news for Ireland’s first homeless choir, as they have been announced as the headliner for the upcoming Sligo International Choral Festival.

The High Hopes Choir will kick off proceedings at the 28th Sligo International Choral Festival at the Gala Concert in the Knocknarea Arena on Friday 11 November at 8pm.

Sean Larkin, festival chairman for the event, says: “We are delighted to announce, on World Homeless Day, that the High Hopes Choir will join us at the Sligo International Choral Festival for their first ever performance in Sligo.”

High Hopes will kick off the festival, which will take place over three days and include a range of styles, ranges and ensembles, from school choir and jazz orchestras to gospel and barbershop choirs. Around 58 entries have been submitted from both Irish and international choirs for the festival.

The High Hopes Choir is supported by several charities across the country, including Dublin Simon Community, Saint Vincent de Paul, Focus Ireland and Penny Dinners Cork.

The group most recently performed at last weekend’s Busker Fleadh in Smithfield, and the choir, which since 2014 has involved more than 90 homeless adults, continue to perform throughout the country led by former RTE Concert Orchestra principal conductor, David Brophy.

Larkin adds:

We look forward to the 80-strong choir joining us and we will be providing accommodation for them. We are looking for donations in order to help us fund the visit from this inspirational choir and are asking members of the public to help.

Alexander says that the choir continues to help change the public perception around homelessness and what it means to be homeless in Ireland today, from its regional choirs in Dublin, Cork and Waterford.

new guide launched to help women protect themselves on Facebook,"A NEW SAFETY guide was launched today geared towards showing women how to better protect themselves on Facebook.

A Guide to Staying Safe on Facebook was launched today by Women’s Aid and Facebook at the company’s HQ.

The guide was created with safety experts and NGOs in the field of women’s safety, such as the National Network to End Domestic Violence in the US (NNEDV).

It provides practical advice on three key areas: security, privacy and having a trusted network on the social media platform.

The guide details things like how to set up login approvals, login notifications and how to perform privacy checks so that people can check how private their profile is to strangers.

It also offers advice on how the unfriend and block people as well as activate timeline review and other features other people may not know about.

Women’s Aid is an organisation dedicated to helping victims of domestic abuse.

According to the organisation, online and offline stalking, damaging rumours, partners demanding access to private passwords and sexually explicit images being shared without consent are among common digital abuse issues reported through its helpline.

“Digital abuse in intimate relationships is real and it is harmful,” said director of Women’s Aid Margaret Martin.

“We have long been concerned about disclosures of digital abuse made to our National Freephone Helpline and other services.

The impact of this type of insidious abuse on women’s lives cannot be underestimated.

Locals hopeful Ballymun site will sell and rejuvenate town,"A 1.83 ACRE plot of land has gone on sale in Ballymun, which locals are hopeful will rejuvenate the town.

The site went on sale yesterday, with no list price available. It is close to the existing shopping centre.

The new development must be four storeys in keeping with the current streetscape and the development plan for mixed use areas but is zoned for a number of uses including residential and commercial.

This is the fourth time the land has gone on sale, but Sinn Féin councillor for the area Noeleen Reilly is hopeful this time it will sell.

“Residents have been crying out for shopping facilities for decades in the area. The regeneration was a big letdown in terms of economic development.

“A recent survey conducted by Dublin City Council reported that only 10% of residents in Ballymun shop in the local area.

“This is a staggering statistic but is symptomatic of the lack of shopping facilities in Ballymun.”

The piece of land on offer has been enlarged after negotiations with retailers and Dublin City Council. It is located on Ballymun’s main street near Ikea and the M50.

Reilly says that the local development plan and the site’s specifics mean that it is a real opportunity for developers and the town.

“There is huge potential to develop shopping facilities in the area and to create jobs for local people in retail and construction.

“There is also the potential to build residential units and office space, both of which we are short of in the area.”

The closing date for offers is 12 November.",https://www.thejournal.ie/ballymun-site-goes-on-sale-3024856-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
This is the tallest wooden building in the world,"OCCUPYING 18 STOREYS of the Vancouver skyline and taking just 70 days to build, the University of British Columbia hopes that Brock Commons will become a trendsetter.

The student accommodation is 53 metres tall and was completed less than 70 days after the prefabricated components were first delivered to the site. Construction will now focus on interior elements, with completion expected in early May 2017 — 18 per cent (or four months) faster than a typical project. The building is expected to welcome more than 400 students in September 2017.

“This remarkable building, the first of its kind in the world, is another shining example of Canadian ingenuity and innovation, an apt demonstration of how Canada’s forest industry is finding new opportunities through technology and innovation — opening up a world of possibilities for our forest and construction industries,” said Jim Carr, Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources.

Brock Commons is the first mass wood, steel and concrete hybrid project taller than 14 storeys in the world. The building has a concrete podium and two concrete cores, with 17 storeys of cross-laminated-timber floors supported on glue-laminated wood columns. The cladding for the facade is made with 70 per cent wood fibre.

“Brock Commons is living proof that advanced wood products are a terrific material to build with and support efficient assembly. It also showcases new applications for B.C. lumber, leading to new job opportunities in BC’s forest industry,” said Steve Thomson, Minister of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations.

As a “living laboratory,” Brock Commons will also be a source of learning through interdisciplinary research and educational projects undertaken by UBC faculty, staff and students.

The project is expected to cost approximately CA$51.5 million, with CA$47.07 million financed by UBC.

What does it take to win a Michelin star?,"Chef Grant Achatz places one of the many courses on a server's tray in the Alinea restaurant kitchen in Chicago.

Chef Grant Achatz places one of the many courses on a server's tray in the Alinea restaurant kitchen in Chicago.

IT IS THE most prominent accolade in the culinary industry.

The Michelin Star has, to many chefs and customers, become not just a desire, but an obsession.

Others, meanwhile, stumble upon theirs, receiving it not because they set out to, but because others tell them they are worthy.

The Michelin Guide, which launched its 2017 edition this week, was first published in 1900 as a way to increase road tripping and demand for cars in France.

In 1926, the company began sending anonymous reviewers to restaurants and a decade later began the star system as we know it.

Essentially, the one, two and three star ratings mean: go if you’re in the same place, make a detour to go here and go out of your way to go here respectively.

This year, there are 12 Michelin starred restaurants on the island of Ireland: 10 in the south, two up north.

But what makes a Michelin-starred restaurant? Is it even quantifiable? In Dublin alone, there is a huge difference between the food on offer in Chapter One and L’Ecrivain, in Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud and new entrant Heron and Grey.

Rebecca Burr is the editor of the Michelin Guide and she told TheJournal.ie that its work is not cut and dried.

Making decisions

Inspectors, as the reviewers are called, will eat in restaurants in their local areas and submit reviews for the guides – which do not only focus on the stars. Some are worthy of mention, some of a Bib Gourmand and some of a star. When the decision is made on the star, things get a little more complicated.

It’s a combination of inspectors eating alone and eating with other staff. The inspectors will make an analysis of if it’s a star and we might then eat with them. It’s up to us to represent the chefs and review every restaurant.”

That drive to be certain means eating at some of the world’s best restaurants again and again.

For this year, we had eight experiences at (Heston Blumenthal’s three-starred and £255 per-person) the Fat Duck.

While that may sound an enviable task, Burr points out one major pain about it.

“It’s a tough job getting bookings because they’re so in demand and we would never reveal who we were.”

Chef Grant Achatz places one of the many courses on a server's tray in the Alinea restaurant kitchen in Chicago. Source: AP/Press Association Images

Indeed, to protect the process of awarding stars, Michelin guards its privacy. However, the idea that reviewers keep their identities secret from even their families is an apocryphal tale. Though some single eaters are often mistaken for Michelin reviewers.

I think that has become exaggerated over the years. The team in America had one woman who didn’t tell her mother because she was a bit chatty and I think the editor mentioned it in an interview, so it spiralled from there.

“We like to think we’re approachable, we just don’t like to be too out there.

“At the same time, we’re not fools, we know if we’ve been detected. Years ago, chefs may have given you special treatment, but times have changed, chefs don’t play those games any more.”

Net effect

So what is the effect of a star? Does it make or break a place?

#Open journalism No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you Support us now

Not really.

A star can make business boom for some, but most locals know if a restaurant is worth visiting before they are awarded, Burr says.

We tend to hear that restaurants have phones ringing off the hook, but many already had very busy restaurants before that. Heron and Grey for example, is already very successful, we just came along and added what we thought.

“There’s no such thing as a typical Michelin starred restaurant. I think that’s what makes the stars interesting.

We would say to restaurant owners: don’t spend loads of money on interiors, but we say invest in the kitchen – not the toys, spend on the chefs and the ingredients.

And those chefs who don’t achieve stars? Do they beat down the doors demanding answers?

Chefs don’t get us on the phone but you can sense they’re disappointed.

“Chefs know if every plate on the pass is perfect.”

Now, with the 2017 guides published, attention is already on 2018′s edition.

IF YOU SAW a crowd of dogs, cats, ponies, sheep, chickens and some humans descending on Knock last Saturday, it wasn’t a miracle you were witnessing, but the Blessing of Pets at Knock Shrine.

Organised by the Family Centre at Knock, the event aims to:

…acknowledge the important role that pets play in the lives of individuals and families as loyal companions who help to brighten our days and help to see us through difficult times. It was a relaxed and good humoured day in Knock.

This is the second year the event has taken place – rerun again this year due to the sheer popularity of the festival. It all took place on the green, outside the Family Centre.

This year the festival attracted a miniature pygmy goat, ‘Dancer’ the pony, Polly the sheep and her friend Penny the hen, as well as lots of cute puppies and dogs.

The Blessing of Pets.

Father Richard Gibbons led prayers and went amongst the crowd to bless all of the animals and their owners and sprinkle them with holy water.

There was also music led by some members of the junior choir in Knock. Those that were not able to bring their pets sent in photographs which were mounted on the pet display board.

$5 billion Irish-founded company Stripe has just gotten a massive boost from Japan,"PAYMENT PROVIDER STRIPE has secured backing from a third major credit card company, signaling a rise in traditional financial businesses taking a stake in the growing fintech sector.

Co-founded by Limerick brothers Patrick and John Collison, Stripe provides software for online merchants to handle transactions.

Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Card Company, the country’s largest credit card provider, has joined Visa and American Express by investing an undisclosed sum in the startup, which is currently valued at $5 billion.

The announcement came on the same day that Stripe rolled out its operations in Japan following a successful beta launch, just two weeks after the platform went live in Singapore.

“This is a really significant project for us and something we have been working on and thinking about for a long time,” chief executive Patrick Collison told Bloomberg television. “We started investigating how to best go about launching in Japan two years ago.”

John (left) and Patrick Collison Source: Pamela Littky/Stripe

Collison described the Japanese launch as a “long-term project”, adding that it required “significant sensitivity” to adapt the service to Asian markets.

When asked how the company would handle differing consumer behaviour in Asia, where cash is preferred to credit, Collison said that “card penetration is quite high” in Japan.

“There are 3.2 cards per consumers here in Japan. It’s already one of most successful and largest e-commerce markets in the world,” he said, arguing that consumer behaviour is changing in the region due to the “rapid rise of the smartphone and the concomitant growth in electronic transactions”.

“We look at this as not bringing a new behaviour to Japan, but rather building better infrastructure that enables Japanese technology companies to implement new business models and to expand to new and growing markets.”

Japan

PayPal founders Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Max Levchin took a stake in Stripe as part of a previous funding round. PayPal’s subsidiary Braintree, which it acquired in 2013 for a reported $800 million, operates in the Japanese market as well.

Collison said the beta version of Stripe grew “substantially faster” in Japan that he expected.

“From the standpoint of the technology companies based here, (Stripe) makes them more effectively address a global market,” Collison said. ”I don’t think the rest of the world has woken up to just how vibrant the Japanese technology and startup scene is rapidly becoming.”

Tokyo Source: Koji Sasahara/AP/Press Association Images

He claimed that the service would “increase sales of Japanese products and Japanese services on a global stage” as companies there can use Stripe to accept payments from Europe, the US and other regions.

Collison wouldn’t reveal where Stripe is looking to expand to next, but a beta version is available in Hong Kong as well as several European countries.

Banks

It is not just credit card heavyweights that are worried about startups like Stripe: banks are keeping an eye on them too.

AIB’s head of business banking, Catherine Moroney, told Fora earlier this year that the lender is more concerned about the performance of digital-payments companies than the prospect of a rival moving into the Irish market.

Last year a report from Deloitte suggested that lenders across Europe risked losing out on billions of income to technology companies over the coming years.

The report estimated that the payments market for banks across the continent was worth about €128 billion now and predicted that would grow to €139 billion by 2030, €22 billion less because of new technologies.

Toyota have said the robot is closer to a talking toy than artificial intelligence.

THE NEW ROBOT from Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp. can’t do much but chatter in a high-pitched voice.

The 39,800-yen (€350), 10-centimeter -tall, doll-like Kirobo Mini — whose name comes from “kibo,” or “hope,” and “robot” — supposedly has the smarts of a FIVE-year-old.

Fuminori Kataoka, general manager in charge of the project, says its value is emotional, going from home to car to the outdoors as a faithful companion, although the owner must do all the walking and driving.

Preorders start later this year. Shipments are set for next year. No overseas sales are planned so far.

The company said it planned a gradual rollout, initially limited to Tokyo and Aichi prefecture in central Japan, near company headquarters, to get feedback from consumers.

It comes equipped with a camera, microphone and Bluetooth, and connects to a smartphone, which needs to be installed with a special software application. It turns its head toward a voice, although sometimes that function fails as its voice recognition is far from perfect.

“Toyota has been making cars that have a lot of valuable uses. But this time we’re just pushing emotional value,” Kataoka said.

During an interview with The Associated Press, the robot turned its head to the reporter and then to Kataoka when he replied.

But the first time Kataoka asked the robot for its name, it replied by asking what kind of car he had. It got it right the second time. Kataoka just laughed.

The robot is not equipped with face recognition technology, and so it cannot recognise different people. The idea is one Kiribo Mini per person, according to Toyota.

More people in Japan are living alone, including the elderly and young singles. And they need someone, or in this case something, to talk to, Kataoka said.

But he was amazingly frank about how useless his robot is.

“This is not smart enough to be called artificial intelligence,” he said.

This is about the existence of something you can talk to. A stuffed animal might not answer back, but people do talk to it, like my daughter once did this. But if it talked back, wouldn’t that be better? And isn’t this better than talking to a box?

Some may find depressing, if not disturbing, a vision of a society of lonely people turning to dialogue with machines. But proponents say that’s the reality, and that the technology can serve as a tool to help care for the sick or the elderly.

Naoki Mizushina, researcher at Tokyo-based MM Research Institute, which studies the robotics market, said the robot was too much like talking toys, on sale at cheaper prices, and it seemed to lack concrete functions to make it a big hit, such as linking to online shopping or furnishing convenient information.

“Will this take off? It might be tough,” he said.

But those who like gadgets — and there are quite a few in Japan — may want one. Toyota declined to say how many it planned to ready for preorder, or how many it planned to sell in the first year.

Toyota remains skeptical about how a partner robot would fare abroad, although it remained open to assessing such interest.

The idea of companion robots is already widely accepted in Japan.

Japanese technology and telecom company Softbank Corp. began selling its 198,000-yen (€1,700) humanoid last year. The first batch of 1,000 sold out immediately, and it has sold 10,000 in Japan so far.

Robo Garage, headed by robot designer Tomotaka Takahashi, has brought an array of Kirobo lookalikes, many with more sophisticated functions at higher prices, including Robi, which must be assembled.

Kataoka is hopeful Kirobo will be able to avoid the fate of the Aibo dog-shaped robot from Sony Corp., which was discontinued in 2006, despite outcries from fans.

Here's a look at the world's 5 big health findings,"NEW FIGURES FROM a range of global health publications reveal the key drivers of ill-health, disability, and death in individual countries.

Globally, people’s health is improving, but progress has been far from universal, with the studies highlighting areas where improvements must be made.

The effort brings together 1,870 independent experts in 127 countries and territories as part of the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2015 study collaboration, published in one special issue.

GBD 2015 analyses 249 causes of death, 315 diseases and injuries, and 79 risk factors in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2015.

We’ve compiled the five main highlights from the study here, and taken a look at how Ireland compares to the global findings.

1. Both life expectancy rates and death rates are up

The world population has gained more than a decade of life expectancy since 1980, rising to 69.0 years in men and 74.8 years in women in 2015. The number of annual deaths, meanwhile, have also been increasing – from roughly 48 million in 1990 to almost 56 million in 2015.

In Ireland, the life expectancy is 78 for a man and 83 for a woman – both almost a decade higher than the average (2014). The difference between male and female life expectancy rates is that testosterone is said to shorten life expectancies – while it is suggested that the female hormone oestrogen helps fight against some minor infections and viruses.

There were just under 30,000 deaths in Ireland in 2014 compared to 67,750 births recorded in the same year.

2. Headaches, tooth cavities, and hearing and vision loss each affect more than 1 in 10 people

In 2015, eight causes of chronic disease (affecting people for 3 months or longer) each affected more than 10% of the world population. These include diseases such as cavities in permanent teeth, 2.3 billion people; tension-type headache, 1.5 billion; iron-deficiency anaemia, 1.47 billion; hearing loss, 1.2 billion; migraine, 959 million; and common or refractive vision problems, 819 million.

According to statistics on the HSE website, 38% of the Irish population have a chronic disease, with about 62% of over 65-year-olds having at least one condition.

In a 2008 report on ‘Tackling Chronic Disease‘ published by the HSE, the following comment was made about chronic conditions in Ireland:

Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and morbidity in developed countries. The World Health Organisation has attributed 86% of deaths and 77% of the overall disease burden in Europe to this broad group of diseases. The pattern in Ireland is similar.

According to the HSE, chronic diseases are responsible for about 60% of deaths worldwide and 76% of deaths in Ireland.

3. People are spending more years living with illness and disability

The burden of ill-health has shifted to disabling NCDs (eg, drug use disorders, hearing and vision loss, and osteoarthritis) – mainly due to increases in population numbers and ageing, a trend with massive implications for health systems and the costs of treatment.

According to Social Justice Ireland, there will be nearly one million people over the age of 65 in Ireland by the year 2031, which will require a massive increase in the hospital services on offer.

4. More than 275000 women died in pregnancy or childbirth in 2015, most from preventable causes

Worldwide, maternal death rates have been reduced by nearly a third since 1990, falling from 282 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 196 in 2015, with progress accelerating since 2000. Yet, in 2015 more than 275,000 women died in pregnancy or childbirth, mostly from preventable causes.

Of the 24 countries that have seen increasing maternal death since 2000 – many of these countries have been affected by conflict (eg, Afghanistan and Palestine), but some are also high-income countries like the USA, Greece, and Luxembourg.

Ireland has one of the lowest rates of maternal deaths, constantly ranking around joint sixth in Europe and the world.

5. Deaths in children under five have halved since 1990, but there is slower progress on reducing newborn deaths

Worldwide, the number of deaths in children under the age of five has more than halved from 12.1 million in 1990 to 5.8 million in 2015, and the gap between groups of countries with the lowest and highest rates of child mortality is shrinking. Accelerated progress since 2000 is mainly as a result of tackling infectious diseases like malaria, diarrhoea and measles, the study shows.

One area that needs special attention is neonatal deaths, which accounted for nearly half of all deaths in children under 5 in 2015 (2.6 million). Over a third of countries worldwide still face substantial challenges to reduce neonatal mortality to fewer than 12 deaths per 1000 live births by 2030; with Mali (40.6), Central African Republic (40.2), and Pakistan (37.9) recording the worst rates in 2015.

In 2014, Ireland was shown to have the third highest death rate for children under five in western Europe – with the greatest number of deaths recorded in the zero-to-six-days-old category.

Here's how to get yourself vaccinated this flu season,"AT-RISKS GROUPS like pregnant women and the elderly are be urged by the HSE.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) says that a particularly bad flu season could lead to up to 1,000 deaths in Ireland with some people more at risk than others.

The at-risk groups being specifically urged to get the vaccine include:

People over 65.

Someone with a long-term illness.

Pregnant women.

People in nursing homes.

Healthcare workers.

The flu and pneumococcal vaccine is free for all those in the at-risk groups although patients may have to pay for the consultation.

Those aged 18 years or older in the at risk groups may attend either their GP or pharmacist for vaccination and those under 18 years should attend their GP.

The vaccine and consultation are free for those who are in an at-risk group and who have a medical card or GP visit card.

During last year’s flu season, the HSE estimates that 55.4% of people aged 65 and over who hold a medical card or GP visit card received the flu vaccine. This was down on the two years previous and well below the World Health Organisation’s target of 75%.

For pregnant women, the seasonal flu vaccine can be given at any stage of pregnancy and also protects the baby

The flu vaccine for this season protects people against the three most common flu virus strains that are expected to be circulating this years.

The HSE says that reactions to the flu are “generally mild” and that “serious side effects are very rare”.

Dr Brenda Corcoran, head of the HSE’s National Immunisation Office, is also advising people that the vaccine does not give people the flu.

“The flu vaccine cannot give you the flu as it does not contain any live flu virus and all those at risk should get vaccinated as soon as possible this year to make sure that they are protected,” she says.

Further details about flu season can be found on the HSE’s flu website.",https://www.thejournal.ie/flu-vaccine-2-3007085-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
the Northern Lights could be on display in Ireland's skies tonight,"YOU DON’T NEED to take trip to Iceland to see the spectacular Northern Lights – according to experts, they could appear in our own skies tonight.

Astronomy Ireland says that a ”huge display of the Northern Lights is forecast for Irish skies this evening as billions of tonnes of radiation is spewed out by the sun directly at Earth”.

David Moore, Editor of Astronomy Ireland explained:

We’ve been monitoring the radiation coming from the sun and NASA and other bodies are predicting the Northern Lights will spill out of polar regions and come as far south as Ireland tonight and possibly the next few nights.

He advised that if you want to see the lights, you should keep a close eye on the north horizon:

“But if the display is as big as those 10 years ago the whole sky could be ablaze with rays and curtains of dancing aurora, one of the most spectacular sights in nature”.

Up in Reykjavik, they’ve been seeing an amazing display this week – the city’s council even switched off street lighting in some areas for an hour to cut light pollution so that the aurora borealis could be clearly visible.

Whether we get to see the Northern Lights or not will depend on how clear the skies are – so fingers crossed there won’t be too much cloud.

To help out, Astronomy Ireland will be setting up some of the most powerful telescopes in Ireland so that members of the general public can share the views.

That’s because as well as the Northern Lights, it will be possible to see Mars and Saturn. “Mars will stay with us, low in evening skies for a few months, but Saturn will be gone by next month,” said Moore.

The telescopes will be available to use for free from 7.30pm tonight at Astronomy Ireland’s headquarters in Rosemount Business Park, Blanchardstown, Dublin.",https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-lights-ireland-2-3002811-Sep2016/,the_journal,1
Security company to hire 85 new staff at Irish headquarters,"THERE WAS GOOD news on the jobs front this afternoon as Carlow company Netwatch announced 85 new positions.

Volunteers are reclaiming this motte and bailey after decades of neglect and bonfires,"The mound at Gallows Hill has been charred through years of bonfires Source: Abarta Heritage

FIVE MONUMENTS AROUND Ireland are currently being ‘adopted’ by their local communities.

Following in the footsteps of a similar initiative in Scotland, the Heritage Council and Abarta Heritage launched the Adopt a Monument scheme this year.

Over 90 community groups around the country applied to the scheme and five were chosen:

Doon Fort, Ardara, Co Donegal

Church of the Rath, Killeshandra, Co Cavan

Gallows Hill medieval fort, Dungarvan, and Round Hill, Lismore, Co Waterford

Baravore crusher building, Glenmalure, Co Wicklow

Ballintleva Handball Alley, Co Roscommon

One of the projects was a joint application from the communities of Dungarvan and Lismore in Co Waterford to adopt two medieval forts in their localities.

Gallows Hill in Dungarvan is located in the Cathal Brugha social housing estate, which is currently undergoing regeneration with Waterford County Council. The Adopt a Monument scheme is working with the community to help raise awareness of the site for visitors and locals.

Geophysical surveys have been carried out to discover more of the site’s story, and the community ran a Medieval Fair Day during Heritage Week in August to help to raise awareness.

Gallows Hill Medieval Fair Source: Abarta Heritage

Speaking to TheJournal.ie, Christina Knight of the Waterford County Museum said the motte and bailey at Gallows Hill had been “completely abandoned and forgotten about” for a long time.

“It has been very neglected for the last few decades”, Knight told us, noting the effects of anti-social behaviour, dumping and bonfires.

She said the museum noticed the site wasn’t mentioned in Dungarvan’s town charter when marking its 800th anniversary last year.

They decided to carry out a community survey to get local people “to take ownership of the site again”.

“When we saw [the Adopt a Monument scheme] we knew it was just a perfect fit for what we were trying to do,” Christina noted.

She said the project is about “bringing the community together” and “making people aware [the site] is there and it’s a really important site”.

People who lived less than half a mile from the site, around corner from it, had never seen it. It’s so surrounded by housing estates it has been completely missed and forgotten about.

“The passion of the local volunteers and the knowledge of the Heritage Council is a great combination,” Knight added.

The Heritage Council is helping local volunteers put together a long-term plan for the site. A geophysical survey was carried out in July, where machinery used radars to penetrate deep into the earth.

Knight said a very large defence ditch was found during this exercise, meaning the site “certainly was a really important defence site at some stage”.

She said it’s at least medieval, possibly older. The next step is trying to more accurately date it.

The large motte and bailey known as Round Hill, also once a defensive site, is situated on the banks of the River Blackwater in Lismore. Heritage Ireland said the Adopt a Monument team is providing “specialist advice in helping to conserve the monument and to provide better access for visitors”.

‘Some of the finest archaeology in Europe’

Ian Doyle, head of conservation with the Heritage Council described the Adopt a Monument programme as “a new way of bringing monuments into the heart of a community”.

“For participants it offers opportunities to work collaboratively, to undertake research and to get to know more about the history of the area.

Ireland has some of the finest archaeology in Europe and to date we have not really understood how valuable a resource this is.

Doyle said the initiative has the potential to ensure ongoing maintenance and care of the monuments, as well “greater protection through increased civic value, and much higher standards of interpretation and understanding”.

Family Fortunes: Lucky brothers and sisters share huge Lotto jackpot,"A LUCKY SIBLING syndicate collected a cheque for €2,307,937 at National Lottery headquarters in Dublin late on Thursday evening.

The group of brothers and sisters, who want to remain private, bought their ticket at Dunnes Stores on Georges Street in Dublin on the day of the draw.

Two ticketholders matched the first six numbers out of the drum on 10 September to share the Lotto jackpot of over €4.6 million.

The second winning ticketholders, another family syndicate from Westmeath, claimed their prize on 21 September.

Hit the jackpot

The Dublin winners now plan to splash out on a family holiday.

Speaking from the National Lottery winners’ room, a spokeswoman for the group spoke of their disbelief at their massive win.

She said:

We only checked our tickets after we heard about the other winning family syndicate from Westmeath and we realised there was another winning ticket from Dublin. Since we checked our numbers, we haven’t had any sleep with the excitement.

“I think we would be an incredibly sensible bunch so we will get the cheque into the bank and take some time out to think about our win. The first big thing we want to do is to treat the whole family to a holiday in the Caribbean after Christmas so we can celebrate properly.

“We will obviously be looking after our Mam and Dad, it is a happy family occasion and we plan to enjoy it for a long time.”

Happy to share

While their jackpot win could have been doubled had it not have for another winning ticket, the overjoyed siblings were more than happy to share in their good fortune.

The spokeswoman added: “’One of the first things we discussed as a group is how we are all genuinely delighted that we have shared this jackpot with another family. It’s such a nice amount to win and it’s lovely to think that a large Lotto jackpot can be shared between two family syndicates and we would like to wish them all the best of luck.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/lotto-syndicate-family-winners-3004296-Sep2016/,the_journal,1
The pioneering Rosetta probe has crash-landed on Comet 67P,"EUROPE’S PIONEERING ROSETTA spacecraft concluded a 12-year odyssey today with a controlled crash-landing onto the comet it has orbited and probed for two years to unravel the secrets of the Solar System’s birth, mission controllers said.

Wild cheering erupted in the mission control centre in Darmstadt, as spacecraft operations manager Sylvain Lodiot announced the official end of mission.

It reached Comet 67P on 6 August 2014, 10 years after setting out on its journey through the solar system.

The stated plan was to take detailed pictures of the surface before the crash. Scientists said they were hoping to get valuable data and stunning images in the final moments before the collision.

Comet 67P is zipping through space at a speed of over 14 kilometres per second.

Rosetta was programmed to make a “controlled impact” at human walking speed, about 90cm per second.

Speaking earlier on a European Space Agency (ESA) YouTube hangout, Rosetta flight director Andrea Accomazzo said Rosetta was never designed to land:

From an energy point of view it will be a soft landing. But Rosetta’s not designed to land, so there will be some energy dissipation.

“For sure, Rosetta will bounce or tumble on the surface of the comet, but will not bounce back into orbit.”

A decision was made to crash the spacecraft because the comet is heading so far from the sun that its solar panels will not be able to generate enough power to keep it functioning for much longer.

"""Keep cyclists alive alive-oh"": Hundreds of cyclists protest outside Department of Transport","Source: RollingNews.ie

HUNDREDS OF CYCLISTS gathered in Dublin this evening to call for more funds to support the country’s cycling infrastructure.

The demonstration, which was organised by the Dublin Cycling Campaign (DCC), began at Government Buildings on Merrion Square, weaved slowly around Stephen’s Green, and stopping outside the Department of Transport on Leeson Lane in the south city centre.

DCC said that the protest was being held to draw attention to the fact that “cycling continues to get the crumbs at the table when it comes to overall national transport spend”.

The crowd, made up of families, working professionals, and public representatives, chanted ‘ten per cent’ – referring to the funding target they want increased – from the current 0.5%.

Green Party leader Eamon Ryan took part in the protest, while the Green’s Ciaran Cuffe gave a rousing speech outside the Department of Transport to the crowd, who sang:

Keep cyclists alive, alive alive-oh.

‘Crumbs at the table’

DCC cites the fact that of the near €10 billion earmarked for transport in the Government’s Capital Investment Plan (CIP) for the next five years, just €100 million has been allocated to so-called ‘active travel’, or sustainable transport such as cycling and walking.

Source: Facebook

Damien Ó Tuama, national cycling co-ordinator with Cyclist.ie, the Irish cycling advocacy network, says that the low-level of funding is the “overarching problem”.

“If you don’t have money allocated to cycling, nothing will happen, that’s what it comes down to,” he says.

“Securing funding is what we’re after,” he adds, saying the government needs to make clear where it stands with regard to the 2009 national cycling framework “which shows how you transition from where we are to a situation where everyone cycles all the time”.

We’re talking cycling training, cycle-friendly road design, driver behaviour moderation, all these kinds of things.

The protest’s organisers are expecting at least 500 cyclists to attend this evening, with speakers such as Ó Tuama himself and Dublin councillors Andrew Montague and Alice Mary Higgins set to give the crowd their two cents.

“With the most recent government we’re not sure what type of priority they’re giving to cycling,” Ó Tuama says.

You can’t just ditch decades-long plans like this.

The single largest investment in the CIP regarding transport is the construction of Metro North, the new rail line between St Stephen’s Green in Dublin city to Dublin Airport, which is estimated to cost in the region of €2.4 billion.

€6 billion meanwhile has been allocated to improving the national roads network.

Pope Francis pays surprise visit to town devastated by earthquake,"POPE FRANCIS HAS made a surprise visit to Amatrice, the small Italian mountain town that bore the brunt of the 24 August earthquake that killed nearly 300 people.

The Argentinian pontiff’s first point of call was a set of colourful pre-fabricated buildings serving as a makeshift school.

Amatrice’s school was destroyed in the quake despite having been expensively renovated to make it quake resistant a few years ago.

Vatican spokesman Greg Burke tweeted pictures of the pope greeting youngsters and shaking hands with a visibly-moved middle-aged man.

Pope and Pastor#PapaFrancesco greets a man who lost his wife and two children in the earthquake pic.twitter.com/7rxgE00Mci — Greg Burke (@GregBurkeRome) October 4, 2016 Source: Greg Burke /Twitter

The man lost his wife and two children in the disaster, according to the Vatican spokesman.

Another image showed Francis standing on his own in front of a pile of collapsed masonry, silently praying.

Accompanied by Domenico Pompili, the bishop of Rieti, Francis was also due to visit the “red zone” area of the devastated town which remains closed to the public for fear of fresh movement of masonry which could pose a risk of injury or worse.

Francis had confirmed his intention to visit the quake-hit area on his flight home from Georgia and Azerbaijan on Sunday, but had not divulged when he intended to go.

He said he wanted to make his visit “privately, alone, as a priest, a bishop, a pope. But alone,” in order to be “near the people.”

The government has estimated the cost of the damage done to the area hit by the quake at €4 billion and has vowed to rebuild the worst-affected communities where they were, having ruled out any relocations.

Amatrice worst hit

Around 1,800 people remain housed in temporary accommodation — either tented villages or hotels in the surrounding area, according to the latest update issued last week.

Francis’s statement on Sunday was a reaffirmation of a pledge he made to worshippers on 28 August, four days after the disaster, to visit the area hit by the 6.0 to 6.2 magnitude quake.

“As soon as possible, I hope to come and see you, to bring you the comfort of faith, the tenderness of a father and a brother,” he said in St Peter’s Square in the Vatican City.

All remaining Dublin Bus strikes CALLED OFF after marathon talks,"Updated at 7.40pm

ALL REMAINING SCHEDULED strike days at Dublin Bus have been called off provisionally, after marathon talks between unions and management.

Members of SIPTU and the National Bus and Rail Union will now be balloted on the proposed new pay deal, which amounts to a significant improvement on the previous offer.

11 days of strike action had been scheduled for later this month. The talks at the Workplace Relations Commission began yesterday morning and continued through the night.

A SIPTU spokesperson confirmed that the strikes had been suspended ahead of a ballot.

Meanwhile, in a statement, head of the NBRU Dermot O’Leary said:

We are prepared, along with trade union colleagues, to believe that the proposals brokered by the WRC after over thirty hours of negotiations are at the optimum that can be achieved at this time, having gone through eight years without a pay rise, two cost cutting plans, inclusive of pay cuts, we remain of the belief that our members are deserving of a significant pay award.

O’Leary added:

We will now move to immediately consult with our members in order to explain the construct of the proposal which has emanated from these comprehensive set of negotiations, it should be understood and appreciated that our members would expect that the WRC proposals will, in the first instance be disseminated directly to them through their respective trade unions in advance of any detailed press briefings.

Improvement

Unions have been seeking pay increases of 15%. They were previously offered 8.25% over the next three years, a deal which their members rejected.

Speaking on RTÉ’s Drivetime this evening, O’Leary indicated that a significant improvement on that deal had been offered, totalling around 11.25% over three years:

“There’s speculation about the quantum of the pay rise. What’s being reported is around 3.75% per year and I’m not going to disagree with that assessment of what the quantum is.

“It’s a good day in terms of our members and they will decide whether the pay on offer and other proposals will pass muster with them.

But in the short term the commuters can console themselves that the industrial action envisaged over the next 10 to 11 days has been suspended.

In recent days, enough progress was made to defer the planned 48 hour stoppage that was due to commence earlier this week.

However, another 11 days of strikes had been planned for October, including this Saturday, when Dublin face Mayo in the All-Ireland final replay.

A series of 48-hour strikes took place throughout September.

THE 2016 NOBEL Peace Prize has been won by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos.

The award comes in recognition of his efforts to end the 52 year civil war with Farc rebels in the South American country.

A referendum in Colombia rejected the deal that was negotiated with rebels but both sides have pledged not to return to fighting.

More than 220,000 people have been killed in the civil war since it began.

The award makes Santos the 15th head of state to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

"After two years of Islamic State rule, the children of Manbij are finally allowed return to school","Syrian schoolchild Mouhannad al-Jassem, 11, who fled with his family from Idlib, plays soccer at a refugee camp in Saadnayel, in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.

Syrian schoolchild Mouhannad al-Jassem, 11, who fled with his family from Idlib, plays soccer at a refugee camp in Saadnayel, in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.

CHILDREN rush out into the schoolyard for break time on the first day of classes in the Syrian town of Manbij, ignoring the Islamic State insignia on a nearby wall.

They savour more than just the late September sun: it is their first normal schoolday after two years of brutal jihadist rule over their hometown.

“We were so happy when we came back to school and we hope we can come every day,” said nine-year-old Ghefran, sporting a low ponytail and light pink sweater.

IS overran Arab-majority Manbij in early 2014, imposing the hardline interpretation of Islamic law it has adopted across its self-styled “caliphate” straddling Syria and Iraq.

The group shut down traditional classes at Ghefran’s Bayram school, painting their black-and-white flag around the place and briefly holding religious courses there.

They renamed it the Abdullah Azzam School after the so-called founding father of global jihad.

Irish volunteers

“When the Islamic State was here, they wouldn’t let us come to school,” Ghefran said.

We missed our teachers And we missed our books.

The jihadists shut hundreds of schools in Manbij and surrounding villages, leaving about 78,000 children without formal education for two years, said the town’s education coordinator Hassan Harun.

But in August this year, a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters called the Syrian Democratic Forces recaptured the town.

They were helped by the Bob Crow brigade, a group of British and Irish volunteers embedded with Kurdish forces in northern Syria.

Harun and his team immediately began inspecting all the schools to see which ones could be renovated and used, and which were damaged beyond repair.

Out of 390 schools in Manbij and the surrounding villages, 192 schools reopened this year, while 59 are still being restored.

The other schools are in areas still under IS control, Harun said.

Manbij is located on the western bank of the Euphrates, northeast of Aleppo and south of Kobane and Jarabalus on the Turkish border. Source: Google Maps

Dark memories

“The opening of the school year was really beautiful,” Harun said, shaking his head and smiling.

Wherever I used to go, everyone used to ask me: when will the schools open? Everyone was so excited.

He has dark memories of IS’s rule, telling AFP that six of his colleagues were beheaded by the group after accusations they had been “collaborating with the regime.”

At the Bayram school, children took a break from classes to sprint around the courtyard with a deflated football or play a game with pebbles.

Inside, about two dozen students fidgeted on wooden benches as a pair of young teachers explained how they would squeeze two academic years into the next 10 months to help students catch up.

Little Rana al-Hussein beamed at the front of a sparse classroom, the meagre pile of books on her desk the only ones visible.

“When the Daesh guys were here I didn’t study. I went to school for two or three days then I stopped,” said the nine-year-old, using the Arabic acronym for IS.

It broke my heart when they used our schools to store mines.

After two years without an education, she will complete her third and fourth years together.

But that has not dimmed her ambitions: “I hope to get a job as a doctor so I can help people and feed them,” Rana said.

‘No better feeling’

Tarek al-Sheikh, a thin teacher at Bayram, said it pained him to see schools in his hometown locked up during IS’s rule.

“It was even more painful to see a kid trying to learn a trade, or walking down the street playing with a ball because he had nothing to do,” Sheikh said.

While teachers are elated to be back in the classroom, they recognise there is much work to be done.

There are very few books and school supplies, and children are so behind that students of all ages are lumped in the same classroom.

“As you can see some of the students who were in third or fourth grade barely remember their letters,” said Hassan Othman, a teacher in his 20s.

When schools were shut, it felt for teachers as if everything you worked for, all the labour you put in, was left behind as you sat at home.

“So you can imagine what it felt like for us to finally reap what we had sowed (when schools reopened). There is no better feeling.”

Australia softens its tax on backpackers after outcry from farmers,"AUSTRALIA WATERED DOWN plans for a “backpacker tax” on foreigners on working holidays, after an outcry from farmers and tourism operators.

Canberra had been under increasing pressure to shelve the tax – 32.5 cents for every dollar earned – amid fears it would deter tourists from choosing the country as a destination.

Some 600,000 backpackers travel to Australia every year, many of them finding work picking fruit, and farmers had complained bitterly that the tax could affect labour supply at harvest time.

“We recognise absolutely the important part that backpackers play in the overall tourism industry,” Treasurer Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra.

It is an important sector for the tourism industry, also a very important source of labour in the agricultural sector, particularly for seasonal labour.

Morrison said the visa application for working holidaymakers would be cut by Aus $50 (€34) to Aus $390 (€260).

Under the new proposed tax set to be in place from 1 January 2017, backpackers would be levied 19% on earnings from the first dollar made.

Currently, like other workers, backpackers do not start paying tax until their annual income exceeds Aus $18,200 (€12,426).

‘Sigh of relief’

Morrison said the loss in projected government revenue of an estimated Aus $540 million (€368 million) over the next three years would be made up via a $5 rise in the departure tax for all passengers leaving Australia.

Backpackers will also be hit with a 95% tax on their superannuation (pension) accounts when they leave Australia.

The tourism sector will meanwhile be given Aus $10 million (€6.8 million) to market Australia to backpackers, who are often young and work in agriculture and hospitality.

“Farmers across the nation are today breathing a sigh of relief following the announcement,” the National Farmers’ Federation said in a statement. President Brent Finlay added:

We have consistently said agriculture simply cannot do without backpackers.

“The nature of these types of working arrangements is that farmers need an immediate, temporary workforce and backpackers want immediate cash in their pockets to spend while travelling – so the approach taken makes sense.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/australia-backpacker-tax-2997949-Sep2016/,the_journal,1
Council wants to ban cars and lorries from part of the quays in Dublin,"A map of the proposed rerouting of car and cycle traffic around the north quays in Dublin city centre. Source: Dublin City Council transport report

DUBLIN CITY COUNCIL has proposed a two-way cycle route along the north quays in Dublin city centre in a new report compiled by planners.

The report, seen by TheJournal.ie, will be presented to the City Council’s transport committee this afternoon. It would see a continuous cycle path along the River Liffey, from Heuston Station to Dublin’s docklands.

Due to the narrow roadway along part of Ellis and Arran Quays, car and lorry traffic will be diverted from this 450 metre-long stretch, between Blackhall Place and Church Street, along a parallel route through Smithfield.

Buses and taxis will retain full access to the quays, and motorists will also be able to drive almost 4km of the 4.4km stretch.

It follows the decision, last week, by the Mayor of Paris to ban private cars along stretches of the Seine.

Riverside

Last May, the council decided to move the original Liffeyside cycle path away into back streets behind Croppies Acres until Church Street.

In this latest report, Brendan O’Brien, head of technical services for the environment and transportation department of Dublin City Council, said they had revisited the “iconic” riverside cycle route option, as the back-street option would not provide full segregation and drew opposition from the National Council of the Blind.

In the report to be presented today, he writes:

In light of the negative commentary received in relation to Option 5, it was decided to completely review all options for the Liffey Cycle Route from Church Street Bridge to Frank Sherwin Bridge in order to meet the requirements set out both in the original project brief and the clearly stated preference of the transport committee members.

Dublin City Council has been trying to develop a segregated cycle route along the north quays since 2012, but the plan has been buffeted by opposition from some business groups.

However, a snap poll on Twitter by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce this week indicated strong support for the new plan to ban private traffic along a particularly narrow stretch of the quays.

Whoops! We couldn't find this Tweet

Allocation

Nine cyclists have died in Ireland this year, and several have been injured, including a hit and run in Dublin, a collision with a taxi; a cyclist fatally knocked off his bike on a cycle lane; and deaths in Kerry, Louth and a boy in Offaly.

Cllr Paddy Smyth said he would vote in favour of the new plan.

“With regard to the impact on the private motor car, it always struck me a ludicrous that someone could look at the Liffey’s majestic riverscape and think to themselves, “what this needs is a dual-carriageway either side!” he told TheJournal.ie.

“I regret however that Croppies Acre will not be now extended to the quayside. It is a missed opportunity to turn an unused space into a fantastic waterside amenity.”

Smyth added said that it could be a while before any vote takes place, as the entire project – Luas Cross City, College Green plaza, Liffey cycleway and Dublin Bus reroutes – may require an environmental impact assessment.

The Dublin Cycling Campaign, which drew up to 1,000 people to a protest against the low allocation (around 1%) of transport funding for cycling and walking this week, is hopeful the plan will succeed.

Return on investment

The campaign wants 10% of transport funds to be dedicated for cycling and walking infrastructure, due to the high return on investment in terms of health and environmental benefits.

“We are very happy with the outcome of the report, but we realise it will be difficult to get through the council,” spokesman Colm Ryder told TheJournal.ie. ”We’d say to motorists that there are a number of positives in relation to the route that’s being suggested.”

The Green Party chairman of the council’s transport committee, councillor Ciaran Cuffe has welcomed the latest plan as a “reasonable compromise”.

If the strategic policy committee approves the entire Liffey Cycle Route (including today’s report), it is hoped that the entire scheme will proceed to public consultation.

Last week, Paris approved a plan to ban cars on a 3.3km stretch of riverside road cutting across the city. Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo hailed the move as a “historic decision, the end of an urban motorway and the taking back of the Seine”.

A centrepiece of her battle against pollution, the plan has gained 55% support among Parisians.

Dublin Bus drivers have accepted a new pay deal,"THE MAJORITY OF Dublin Bus drivers have accepted a new pay deal from management, ensuring that no further days of strike action will go ahead.

Drivers from both Siptu and the National Bus and Rail Union accepted the pay proposals.

The drivers with the NBRU accepted pay proposals from the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) by a margin of 79% to 21%.

The margin was tighter with Siptu drivers. With 58% accepting the pay deal and 42% rejecting it.

The other grades that Siptu represents voted in favour by majorities of between 70% to 90%.

Results from three smaller unions are expected after the weekend.

Transport Minister Shane Ross said that he welcomed the news but noted that there were further ballots to take place.

NBRU general secretary Dermot O’Leary said that drivers had accepted the new proposals “despite reservations” about some of the issues.

“In doing so our members have once again demonstrated that it is their desire to continue to provide a public bus transport service to the citizens of our capital city despite the lack of support by the State in providing sufficient subvention,” he said.

The pay proposal involves an annual pay increase of 11.6% over the next 15 months.

Siptu division organiser Owen Reidy said the planned strikes for October would now not go ahead.

“This result today means that the long running dispute at the company is over and the series of eight scheduled days of work stoppages during October will not now occur,” he said.

Dublin Bus services ground to a halt over a number of days last month as workers took industrial action in a dispute over pay.

Dublin Bus workers were seeking a 15% pay increase over the next three years and a 6% rise they say they were due to get under an agreement in 2009, but which was deferred.

Unions in August rejected a Labour Court-recommended 8.25% increase over the next three years.

Archaeologists hope to uncover the secrets of the Hellfire Club with tomb dig,"Source: Neil Jackman

A TEAM OF archaeologists are undertaking a dig at the Hellfire Club in the Dublin Mountains, where they hope to uncover some of the secrets of famous site.

Four archaeologists, as well as students from UCD, are taking part in the Hellfire Club Archaeological Project, which is supported by South Dublin County Council (SDCC), Coillte and Abarta Heritage.

The dig is aimed at uncovering the story of Montpelier Hill, where the ruins of the Hellfire Club are located.

Neil Jackman of Abarta Heritage told TheJournal.ie that they’re aiming to discover the condition of what is believed to be a passage tomb near the Hellfire Club ruins.

“The tomb itself is quite large, over 30m in diameter,” he explained. “It was largely destroyed when they were building the Hellfire Club.” It’s believed that stones from the tomb were used in the creation of the building, which has long been linked by some to supernatural happenings.

Even for those who don’t visit to be spooked out, the site provides a remarkable view of Dublin.

The archaeologists are opening a quarter of the tomb and have already dug a strip of about 2m wide across the area. They’ve taken off the grass and topsoil from this area and will soon begin to dig deeper into the site.

“Then we will start opening a bigger area and find out the complexity of the area,” said Jackman, pointing out that they need to do it “in a very manageable way” as the site needs to be returned to as it was when the dig concludes at the end of October.

They’ve already made a few interesting finds – no bones, but they have found everything from bags of crisps from the ’90s to pottery from the early 1800s. They’ve also found the remains of sparklers and fireworks.

“We’re finding quite a lot of stuff which shows how many people have come up there to enjoy the view,” said Jackman. “It’s the sort of rubbish you can imagine from people partying up there, which is part of the Hellfire Club story.”

As they get deeper through the layers, they are hoping to find prehistoric items. The holy grail, so to speak, would be a piece of bone or charcoal which could be dated.

It’s thought the passage tomb at the site is one of a string of such tombs which goes through the Dublin/Wicklow Mountains.

They include the Seefin tomb in the Wicklow Mountains:

“They’re very interesting sites,” said Jackman. “The last one of these to be excavated in the Dublin Mountains was only done in the 1920s.”

It wasn’t done using modern techniques – there was no radiocarbon dating, for example.

Before [the tomb at the Hellfire Club] was largely destroyed, we believe it would have once been a large circular mound, with a stone lined passageway that led to a burial chamber.

“We know quite a lot about tombs in Boyne Valley but we know nothing about tombs in the Dublin Mountains, we don’t know how old they are,” said Jackman. “The big hope is a bit of charcoal, a bit of bone, something we can date. Are they older than the tombs in Boyne Valley, are they younger?”

It’s an exciting and unusual opportunity to get to excavate a site like this, said Jackman.

“It’s really exciting to get a chance to answer a few of these questions. It’s a beautiful place to be when you’re digging.”

Besides the age of the tomb, they’re also trying to figure out what is left of the site. “Did they completely destroy it or are we going to see the chamber area?”

The dream is to find the original passageways within the tomb. “The ultimate dream is if we can get something to date it – perhaps some megalithic art.”

Passage tombs largely date to about 5,000 years ago, but they became important places once more around 1,000 years later, during the Bronze Age.

Members of the public are invited to visit the site to see how the archaeologists are getting on, but those who can’t pop up can also keep up to date through the Abarta Heritage website, Twitter and Facebook.

In addition to the dig, Jackman is also taking part in a folklore project with schools and SDCC, which involves gathering the local stories people tell about the Hellfire Club.

The dark history of the Hellfire Club

Source: Neil Jackman

The Hellfire Club was built as a shooting lodge for the politician William Conolly in around 1725.

Explained Jackman:

To build the lodge, his workmen destroyed two large tombs, and utilised their stone as building material. The destruction of the tombs marks the beginning of the association of the building with the supernatural.

Legend has it, that a devil was so enraged by the desecration that he blew off the original wooden roof of the new building. As one of the richest and most powerful men in Britain or Ireland, William Conolly was not to be deterred by a mere phantom, and had the roof reconstructed in stone, giving the lodge its unique appearance.

The building is thought to have been idle until 1735, when it is said that his widow, Katherine, leased the building to Richard Parsons, the Earl of Rosse. Parsons was one of the leading figures in what was known as ‘Dublin’s Hellfire Club’, ‘The Blasters’ or the ‘Young Bucks of Dublin’.

This was a group of aristocrats, described at the time by the famous Jonathan Swift as “a brace of Monsters, Blasphemers and Bacchanalians”. The Earl of Rosse in particular was infamous for obscenity, blasphemy and for his habit of receiving guests in the nude. The main meeting place for the Hellfire Club appears to have been The Eagle Tavern on Cork Street.",https://www.thejournal.ie/archaeological-gig-hellfire-club-3010161-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
Enda Kenny announces 100% fibre-optic broadband for his hometown,"Source: Eamonn Farrell

ENDA KENNY HAS announced that construction is now underway on SIRO’s 100% fibre-optic broadband network in Castlebar and that services will become available from December.

The Taoiseach made the announcement this evening at an event in Lough Lannagh Holiday Village, in association with Mayo County Council.

The 100% fibre-optic broadband network is being rolled out in 50 towns nationwide, and will enable residents and businesses to load websites faster as well as upload and download images and videos quicker.

For context, a high definition film would take one hour to download with a 10mbps connection – with this new connection, it will take 30 seconds.

Faster internet connections benefit small to medium enterprises in particular, as it allows them to connect with potential customers abroad, as well as market and advertise on a more regular basis.

“SIRO’s investment will put Castlebar on par with broadband speeds found in major cities around the world,” the Taoiseach said at the launch.

It is especially fitting that Castlebar has been chosen as one of the first ten towns in the country to benefit from being part of SIRO’s €450million network.

This is the first SIRO roll-out in Mayo and I look forward to them progressing to their next roll-out in Westport.

“Having a good broadband service is essential in this day and age, so we are delighted to offer Castlebar residents and businesses broadband that is different and better than any other network in Ireland,” Westnet CEO and co-founder Paul Cunnane meanwhile said.

The issue of Ireland’s National Broadband Plan (NBP), and the poor quality of web access in rural parts of the country, has been a talking point since its first announcement in 2012.

In May of this year Kieran Kelly of Kelco communications described Ireland as being “a first world country with third- or fourth-world infrastructure”.

The Government has since opted to privatise the NBP and hand over full control of the infrastructure to the private sector once the 25-year contract has expired.",https://www.thejournal.ie/enda-kenny-broadband-castlebar-3008576-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
Moving in together! Bohemians and Shelbourne to share redeveloped Dalymount Park,"TWO OF IRELAND’S most successful football clubs, Bohemians and Shelbourne, will groundshare a redeveloped Dalymount Park, it has been confirmed this morning.

An agreement has been reached between Dublin City Council (DCC) and the two League of Ireland clubs for Shelbourne to relocate to the Phibsborough venue once its €20 million redevelopment is complete.

Dalymount Park was purchased by DCC in a deal worth €3.8 million last June and the revamp will see the stadium’s capacity increase to 10,000.

“The decision to leave Tolka was a difficult one for both the Directors of Shelbourne FC Ltd and for the Board of Management of the Club,” a Shelbourne FC statement read.

“It has been our home for almost three decades and during these years the Club enjoyed tremendous success there.

“Both the Directors and the Club’s Board of Management are united in the view that the time is right to start planning a move to pastures new. Tolka Park is increasingly showing its age and there was no prospect of attracting investment to redevelop.”

Shelbourne have been playing their home games at Tolka Park since 1989 after acquiring a long-term lease from the Dublin Corporation, now DCC.

The Drumcondra venue has played host to some of Irish football’s most memorable days, including international matches and Shelbourne’s Champions League ties.

The future of the ground has been in doubt for some time after Shels sold the facility to a local businessman in 2006.

A child crawls on the steps of an abandoned hospital wing, used as a makeshift shelter for around 150 Syrian refugees, in Athens.

IRELAND HAS HANDED over €5 million and announced a further €2.5 million to help Syrians affected by the country’s five-year civil war.

Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan made the announcement today after meeting the EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid Christos Stylianides.

The €5 million will go towards the EU’s humanitarian response to the crisis. The €2.5 million will be paid out in humanitarian assistance through the UN and the Red Cross.

Flanagan said that his talk with the Commissioner had increased his concern about Syria, particularly the besieged town of Aleppo.

He said he was committing the funding to “enhance Ireland’s contribution to meeting the challenges the people of Syria face in accessing food, water and health care”.

“This will bring our total contribution to the Syria crisis since 2012 to over €62 million.

“Ireland remains committed to the delivery of humanitarian assistance.

Every evening on our television screens we see the human toll which the unprecedented number and scale of humanitarian crises is taking, particularly in Aleppo right now.

“There is an onus on all of the international community to do what we can to help alleviate this human suffering and Ireland will continue to play its part.”

An Irish chat show filmed in an attic and broadcast on Facebook is going up against the Late Late,"AN IRISH PRODUCTION company that broadcasts exclusively on Facebook Live will tonight have the third episode of its talk show that goes up against the Late Late.

GoLive Creations has been running since February and a team of eight people are involved in the production of its Late Night at Frank’s chat show.

The programme goes live at 9.25pm each Friday and runs for two hours from the founder Frank McCaughey’s attic.

“Our ridiculously lofty idea is to build a social media TV station,” McCaughey says.

My own feeling is that social media is a bit staid, everything can be so perfectly written an tweeted and filtered. So I felt there was an opportunity to do something a bit authentic, a little left of centre, a little bit raw and unprofessional.

GoLive has been working on the show in unbroadcasted dress rehearsals for months but last month they produced their first live show.

McCaughey says the numbers who’ve tuned in have increased from 500 people to 1,000 people in the two episodes they’ve had.

He says their short-term target is to reach 10,000 likes on Facebook by Christmas and envisages that this could translate into one of three of those people watching.

Some of the interviews on the show are pre-recorded. Tonight, for example, an interview with the head of the Irish Swingers Club was pre-recorded and will be shown ahead of a live panel discussion on the subject.

McCaughey says ultimately it’s hoped that everything will be live but that right now all the technology is there to allow them to cut in and out of live broadcasting.

The team behind GoLive are currently working on either a full-time or part-time basis and are not taking a wage from the company. Most of the team have a background in media and some have been involved in TV before, even if McCaughey’s own background is in marketing.

He says their funding plan would be to get advertising or sponsorship for their current chat show before they branch out into other productions.

McCaughey believes that the broadcasting of TV shows on Facebook has yet to take off, but that live podcasts are showing the way to go.

“Joe Rogan would go live for three hours and he has 500,000 people watching him. So I would be inspired by something like that. But there’s nobody out there I know of that has a late night talk show streaming only through Facebook.”

Katie Taylor to Hell and Back to help four-year-old Sligo boy to walk,"RORY GALLAGHER WAS born eight weeks premature and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at just eight months old.

His parents, Shauna and Gerry from Cliffoney, Sligo, were told their son would never walk or talk but Rory does talk and the family are fundraising to take him over to the US in December for surgeries to allow him to walk.

The couple say they are facing selling their home to fund their son’s treatment.

The family took Rory to Missouri in June 2015 for pioneering surgery called SDR. Three days after the surgery Rory wiggled his toes for the first time. Shauna said:

It’s more than we could ever, ever have wished for … it was just so amazing to see.

Eight days later he took his first steps with the aid of a kaye frame.

The 4-year-old is now facing major surgery to fulfill his dream of independent walking. A pin will be inserted into his right hip as it’s 30% dislocated. He is also due to have a surgery on his right eye, which will further improve his vision.

Rory is scheduled to return to St Louis Children’s hospital in December to undergo these surgeries.

After the surgeries, he will attend a two year conductive education center in Europe to see him reach his full potential.

Shauna Gallagher said, “We are full of hope for Rory and his future and he is full of determination, so together we are going to see his wish to walk come true.”

Rory is halfway there with his wish to walk so there is no way we are giving up now.

Hell and Back

Katie Taylor is taking part in a Hell and Back challenge to raise funds for Rory on 8 October.

Taylor visited Rory when he was having tests in Crumlin Children’s Hospital last month.

His mother Shauna said, “Katie arrived with the largest bag full of toys for Rory and made him feel like the most special little boy in the world.

“She sat chatting for a few hours while playing and cuddling Rory, who didn’t want to leave her knee. She really made such an impact on little Rory.

Herself and her mum Bridget have given me the strength and encouragement to fight on for Rory and not to give up.

Taylor will be joined by Michael Conlan, Paddy Barnes, Gary Spike O’Sullivan and a number of sports stars.

A gofundme page has been set up for Rory, and the family are appealing to the public to donate and help them enable Rory to progress with his wish to walk.",https://www.thejournal.ie/cerebral-palsy-katie-taylor-sligo-hse-2970492-Oct2016/,the_journal,1
Calls to give free Interrail passes to all European 18-year-olds as birthday presents,"A NEW EU proposal will be brought to the parliament next week regarding gifting teenagers with a free interrail pass for their 18th birthday.

The proposal is being put forward by Manfred Weber of the European People’s Party (EEP), the party in Europe aligned with Fine Gael.

Weber is requesting that the European Commission funds and launches an initiative whereby 18-year-olds are gifted a single use interrail ticket for their birthday.

The programme would be funded by the European Commission in cooperation with member states and rail companies.

Interrailing is a common holiday option for Europeans and involves getting trains around Europe from place to place over a period of time.

Typically, a person buys a single multi-use ticket which they can to take trains all around Europe.

“The mobility of young people is essential in promoting a sense of belonging to Europe, enhancing social cohesion and ensuring a competitive European economy,” said Weber in the text of his question to be brought before the European Parliament.

Weber said that mobility of young people in Europe “is not yet widespread” and that ”populism and the spread of misinformation” was one of the biggest threats facing Europe.

He said granting free travel to young people to allow them to travel around Europe and would help combat this.

The proposal was welcomed and supported by Fine Gael MEP Brian Hayes, who said that the pass would help promote tourism and enhance social cohesion.

Hayes also said that Europe needed to “move on from the failure on Brexit”.

“Europe needs to reach out to a younger generation. Europe badly needs to dream again and celebrate the common bonds that tie us together,” he said.

The 18th Birthday Interrail Pass for Europe would give all young people, regardless of their social and educational background, the opportunity to discover Europe.

The proposal is expected to be discussed in the European Parliament next week.",https://www.thejournal.ie/18-interrail-pass-3002516-Sep2016/,the_journal,1
"Colombian rebel group ""reborn"" and apologises after decades of violence","Rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, watch the signing of the peace accords during an event organized by rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC.

Rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, watch the signing of the peace accords during an event organized by rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC.

COLOMBIA’S LEFT FARC rebel force signed a historic peace accord with the government yesterday and apologised to the countless victims of the country’s half-century civil war.

In an emotional open-air ceremony, President Juan Manuel Santos welcomed the communist rebels into the political sphere after signing the accord with FARC leader Rodrigo Londono, alias Timoleon “Timochenko” Jimenez.

Dressed in white, the former mortal enemies signed and shook hands, smiling before an audience of international dignitaries, drawing loud cheers.

The ceremony in the Caribbean coast city of Cartagena followed a four-year process to end the last major armed conflict in the Americas. The accord remains to be ratified by referendum in a week.

“We are being reborn to launch a new era of reconciliation and of building peace,” Timochenko said.

In the name of the FARC, I sincerely apologise to all the victims of the conflict for any pain we may have caused during this war.

Colombian authorities estimate the territorial and ideological conflict has killed 260,000 people, left 45,000 missing and uprooted 6.9 million.

“Let no one doubt that we are moving towards politics without weapons. Let us all prepare to disarm hearts and minds,” Timochenko said.

Santos then addressed a message to the thousands of FARC fighters preparing to disarm in their jungle camps.

When you begin your return to society… as head of state of the homeland that we all love, I welcome you to democracy.

Swapping bullets for votes and weapons for ideas is the bravest and most intelligent decision that any rebel group could take.

The 2,500 guests at the signing included UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, US Secretary of State John Kerry and the Vatican’s Secretary of State Pietro Parolin.

Ban welcomed the agreement creating “conditions for a lasting peace.”

An array of Latin American heads of state, including Cuban President Raul Castro, sat near the signatories on stage as the crowd waved white handkerchiefs and shouted “No more war!”

A squadron of planes flew overhead at sunset, prompting Timochenko to quip: “This time, they’re coming to salute peace and not drop bombs.”

FARC’s political future

The FARC launched its guerrilla war against the Colombian government in 1964, after a peasant uprising that was crushed by the army.

Over the decades, the conflict drew in several leftist rebel groups, right-wing paramilitaries and drug gangs.

Under the deal, the FARC will now relaunch as a political party. Timochenko, 57, is expected to remain its leader.

At a remote jungle camp in El Diamante, western Colombia, FARC fighter David Preciado celebrated the accord by playing football with his comrades.

“The government did not defeat us, and we did not defeat them. Our 52 years of war were not in vain,” he told AFP.

“We are aware that we have to move forward together, united… to finally achieve victory, giving power to the people by political means.”

Amnesty

The rebels came to the negotiating table after being weakened by an army offensive led by Santos, 65, when he was defence minister.

After he became president, four years of talks hosted by Cuba yielded a final, 300-page accord last month.

It grants an amnesty for “political crimes” committed during the conflict, but not for the worst atrocities, such as massacres, torture and rape.

The FARC’s fighters — estimated by authorities to number more than 7,000 — are to leave their mountain and jungle hideouts and disarm in a UN-supervised process.

No to ‘terrorists’

Recent polls show the “Yes” camp in the lead to ratify the accord in a referendum on October 2.

But some Colombians resent the concessions made to the FARC.

Former president Alvaro Uribe led a demonstration against the deal on Monday.

“The Americans would not grant impunity to Osama Bin Laden. The French would not grant impunity to (Islamist militants) ISIS,” he said.

Why should we Colombians grant total impunity to terrorists?

At the ceremony, Santos said: “I prefer an imperfect accord that saves lives to a perfect war that keeps sowing death and pain.”

John Kerry met with Santos and told the Colombian president that “a lot of hard work’s been accomplished, but we have a lot of hard work ahead of us”.

“The United States is very committed to being there with you, not just at the beginning… but now as people will look to see the result,” he said.

The European Union suspended the FARC from its list of terrorist groups, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement.

The government has yet to begin planned peace talks with another, smaller leftist rebel group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), saying it must first stop kidnappings.

Children who grow up on farms less likely to suffer with allergies,"PEOPLE WHO GROW up on farms are less likely to suffer allergies in later life according to a new study.

Data from more than 10,000 people in 14 countries was examined for the research published in the journal Thorax.

It also found that women who lived on farms in early childhood are more likely to have better lung function.

Those who grew up on farms were more likely to have had pets, older siblings and to have shared a bedroom.

They were found to be 57% less likely to have allergic nasal symptoms and 54% less likely to have asthma or hay fever than those who grew up in an inner city.

European award for Cork woman who lost family in crash with suicidal driver,"ROAD SAFETY CAMPAIGNER Elber Twomey, whose family were killed in a car crash caused by a suicidal driver, has been honoured for helping to make Europe’s roads safer.

Twomey lost her husband, infant son and unborn daughter when a suicidal driver hit their car during a holiday in Devon England, four years ago.

Twomey’s husband Con lost his fight for life 10 months after the crash, in Torquay. Her little boy Oisín died in surgery immediately after they were hit at speed by Marek Wojciechowski.

Wojciechowski had left a suicide note at home and was being pursued by a police officer in a marked car moments before he swerved into the Twomeys’ car.

Twomey has since worked with An Garda Síochána and UK police to bring about better mental health and suicide awareness.

Last night Tispol, the European network of traffic police, presented Twomey its president’s award at a major road safety conference in Manchester.

Chief Superintendent Aidan Reid of the Garda National Traffic Bureau said her work has had a huge impact across European police forces which will help save lives.

“Her work has resulted in significant improvements to both police pursuit training, and in particular, in relation to how those working in police control rooms manage or deal with such situations,” said Reid, the current Tispol president.

In 2015 she delivered a powerful address to the 2015 Tispol conference, recounting her own tragedy.

Italian police have found two priceless Van Gogh paintings stolen from a Dutch museum,"View of the Sea at Scheveningen, described by experts as priceless.

View of the Sea at Scheveningen, described by experts as priceless.

POLICE IN ITALY have recovered two Van Gogh paintings stolen in 2002 in Amsterdam.

The works - Seascape at Scheveningen (1882) and Congregation leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen (1884/85) – have been recovered from the Naples mafia, the museum said today in a statement.

The Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam said the works were found during a “massive, continuing investigation” by Italian prosecutors and organised crime officials.

Museum director Axel Rüger said: ”After all those years you no longer dare to count on a possible return.

“We owe a great debt of gratitude to the Italian [authorities].

The paintings have been found! That I would be able to ever pronounce these words is something I had no longer dared to hope for.

The paintings were taken when thieves used a ladder and sledgehammers to break into the museum.

They were among assets worth millions of euros seized from the Camorra group by Italian authorities. The thieves broke into the museum through the roof during the night of 6-7 December 2002 and used sledgehammers to break a first-floor window.

The theft of the two works, described as priceless by art experts, led to criticism of security at the world’s major art museums.

The uninsured paintings, on loan from the Dutch government, were taken off the walls of the main exhibition hall, despite the presence of guards on patrol and infrared security systems.

The museum said it was so far unclear when the works would be returned to Amsterdam but said they appeared to be in “relatively good condition”.",https://www.thejournal.ie/van-gogh-3003511-Sep2016/,the_journal,1

"Heritage pubs owner to recreate interior of 100-year-old shop that was ""gutted out"" last month","The building was described as ""stuck in time"" and ""as rare as hen's teeth"".

The building was described as ""stuck in time"" and ""as rare as hen's teeth"".

THE OWNER OF several heritage pubs in Cork city has said that he would have “cut off his arm” for a building with the interior of J Dempsey’s.

Not only that, but passionate pub owner Benny McCabe has said that he will attempt to recreate the interior of the pub – based on the images taken of the century-old shop a year before it was demolished by its owners.

“I’ve never seen that kind of style around,” he said. “What a crime.”

J Dempsey, situated on Dorset Street in Dublin, had been earmarked for conservation by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) because of its unique historical importance.

But the building was demolished recently by its owners, who most likely had no idea of its historical importance, as there is no statutory obligation on the NIAH to do so.

McCabe called this demolition “a crime” and said that he couldn’t understand the reasoning behind the demolition, given the great condition the building was in.

Source: Dublin Civic Trust

McCabe is the owner of several heritage pubs in Cork City, as well as a member of the Cork Heritage Pubs organisation.

He is the owner of Arthur Mayne’s wine bar, which was a pharmacy from the late-19th century.

“We owned a pub on Crane Lane and were looking to expand. Our landlord Jim Byrne owned the building next door – Arthur Mayne’s Pharmacy so we went to have a look at it.”

It was like a living museum – it had been there since the 1870s and hadn’t been touched. We thought it was so important to remain true to the heritage of the place.

Source: Arthur Mayne's wine bar

There were some alterations they had to make to the interior:

“We had to take a couple of steps out and put a ramp in, and were worried it might ruin the aesthetic, but these are small compromises we had to make.”

He says that even if there is a lot of work to be done with an old building, that there are ways around it; “Dismantle the interior, do whatever to the structure, and put everything back again.

Acquiring old buildings

He says that the process of acquiring the old buildings in Cork is “simple and straightforward” and that there is a lot of goodwill towards the process.

“The recovery hasn’t reached Cork the way it has Dublin, there’s a boom there at the moment and people are overworked – something probably fell through the cracks. But one day they’ll wake up and realise what they’ve lost.

Old retail fades into memory, we’ll miss having something so perfectly preserved and original. It’s all going to become generic.

Although McCabe can’t disclose the exact location of the pub which will replicate the interior of J Dempsey’s, there is one obvious name choice being floated:

Dog set to star in RTÉ show is found after public appeal,"THE OWNERS OF a dog that is set to appear in an RTÉ show have thanked the public for their help in finding her after she went missing.

Sadie, an 18-month-old golden retriever from Midleton, Co Cork, is set to be part of the upcoming show Pet Surgeons.

Her owners Kathryn Cuddy and Cathal O’Shea said their garden was securely locked when Sadie disappeared on Sunday.

She is microchipped and neutered, but her collar was found on the front gate of the house. They believe she was stolen.

Speaking to the Ryan Tubridy Show, Kathryn said the family is “overjoyed” to have Sadie home.

Kathryn said gardaí in Midleton contacted her after a woman reported seeing Sadie in a field near their house.

Kathryn said she and Cathal went to meet the woman within minutes.

“She pointed us in the direction the dog had gone and we headed off across the fields. Cathal went left and I went right and after a few minutes I looked around and the two of them were running across the field towards me.

It was absolutely magical, all we were missing was the Hollywood soundtrack. It was amazing.

‘Very thankful’

Kathryn said Sadie was “very agitated when we found her”, but is doing well now.

“She’s absolutely fine now, thanks goodness. It was nothing that a warm bath and a long sleep and a full tummy couldn’t sort out … she’s back to herself.”

Kathryn said she is “very thankful” Sadie was looked after, and believes whoever took her changed their mind after seeing the appeal to find her.

She said her family knows they are very lucky.

Kathryn, who works as a vet, said she was aware of puppy trafficking but not aware of “how bad a problem” dog theft is.

She encouraged all dog owners to make sure their pets are microchipped and neutered, and urged anyone who sees any suspicious behaviour to report it.",https://www.thejournal.ie/missing-dog-sadie-found-2948426-Aug2016/,the_journal,1

Free 'baby boxes' to be given to new mothers at Limerick hospital,"Dr Mendinaro Imcha, Consultant Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, University Maternity Hospital Limerick and Jennifer Clary, CEO The Baby Box Company with Lisa Healy with her brand new baby, Leah from Templemore, Co Tipperary.

Dr Mendinaro Imcha, Consultant Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, University Maternity Hospital Limerick and Jennifer Clary, CEO The Baby Box Company with Lisa Healy with her brand new baby, Leah from Templemore, Co Tipperary.

THOUSANDS OF “BABY box” sleeping cots are to be provided free of charge to parents of children born in Limerick, in a first of its kind national initiative, aimed at reducing infant deaths.

Today, University Maternity Hospital Limerick (UMHL) – where around 5,000 babies are born every year – launched the Baby Box programme to also help educate parents on how to care for their newborns.

The programme will see mothers who complete e-learning modules provided with a free baby box for their infant to sleep in. The online training element is meant to be inclusive and accessible; easy to follow and available in 17 languages.

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death, is the unexplained death of a child of less than one year of age. It usually occurs during sleep.

Infant mortality rates

The use of Baby Boxes has been credited with helping reduce infant mortality rates in Finland, where they have been in use for over 75 years.

The programme has apparently contributed to reducing the infant mortality rate in Finland, from 65 infant deaths per 1,000 births in 1938 to 2.26 per 1,000 births in 2015. Ireland’s infant mortality rate is 3.7 per 1,000 births.

Other countries, including the UK, Canada and USA, have also begun to introduce the concept.

The Baby Box, made from a durable cardboard, can be used as a newborn’s bed for up to the first six months of their life. It is thought the small size of the box prevents babies from rolling onto their tummies, which experts think can contribute to SIDS.

The boxes also includes baby clothes, a firm foam mattress, waterproof mattress cover, cotton sheet – and advice on recorded tutorials made by UMHL staff on reducing SIDS risk; improving parental bonding; and making the transition to parenthood.

Tradition

Speaking at today’s launch, Dr Mendinaro Imcha, Consultant Gynaecologist/Obstetrician, UMHL, said the programme “is a proactive approach to improving the health and safety of the newborn child and parents”.

“We are combining tradition with current technology and supporting the newborn child’s family with online educational material covering a broad range of essential topics on ante and postnatal care,” he added.

The Baby Box has been rolled out by the Baby Box Co, and designed by Tipperary-based tattoo artist and expectant mum Karen Smith.

“The whole meaning behind the design is rebirth. I thought the butterfly was the perfect symbol for the Baby Box. It is a symbolic creature in many cultures.

It sometimes represents Beauty itself, or metamorphosis, and at other times the transitory nature of happiness and indeed all of life. They lend themselves to all manner of colourful and fanciful adaptations, in our case our beautiful Baby Box,” Smith said.",https://www.thejournal.ie/baby-boxes-limerick-2993241-Sep2016/,the_journal,1
"""Money was sent. I gave it to charity"": 90-year-old in court over satellite dish has case dismissed","Anne and her daughter Ann Claxton outside court last month.

Anne and her daughter Ann Claxton outside court last month.

A NINETY-YEAR-OLD Dublin woman whose initial court appearance made headlines after she was prosecuted for having a satellite dish on her house has had her case dismissed.

Anne Rudd, from Terenure, has been speaking of the support she received from her family and from well-wishers overseas in the weeks since the story first came to light.

“I have had my family around me. There are women and men who have nobody,” she said outside court in Dublin today.

Asked whether she thought justice had been done at today’s hearing she replied:

“I do indeed. I really do.”

The judge ruled that the pensioner would not have to pay costs, and dismissed the case.

Anne – who is also known as ‘Peg’ – initially appeared at Dublin District Court at the end of September and was ordered to pay €1,500 towards Dublin City Council’s legal fees for failing to remove the dish within the required time, after an enforcement notice was sent to her.

Anne told Joe Duffy on Liveline that she had misunderstood the initial letter, which was sent in February. The letter warned that the satellite dish could not be on the front of her home in Terenure without planning permission.

A second letter was sent in June, at which point her family became involved.

The satellite dish – which was a 90th birthday present – was subsequently taken down but after the deadline set by the council.

Planning laws require that satellite dishes must be placed at the side or rear of a home if there is no permission granted.

Speaking today, the Dubliner said she had received wishes from England, Wales, the US and Australia in the last few weeks.

Bunches of flowers were sent to her, she said, adding:",https://www.thejournal.ie/pensioner-satellite-dish-dublin-dismissed-2399623-Oct2015/,the_journal,1
Three-year-old 'Mowgli' found after surviving three days in a Siberian forest,"Three-year-old Tserin Dopchut in the arms of a local rescue worker.

Three-year-old Tserin Dopchut in the arms of a local rescue worker.

A TODDLER HAS been rescued after spending three days alone in a forbidding Siberian forest populated by wolves and bears.

Three-year-old Russian boy Tserin Dopchut sparked a huge land and air search across the Mongolian border when he wandered into the woodland on Sunday 18 September, the Siberian Times reported.

He had been playing with dogs near his great-grandmother near his home in Khut, a village of around 400 people in the Piy-Khemsky district of the Tuva republic, near the vast country’s long Mongolian border.

Tserin was wearing shoes – but no coat – when he wandered into the taiga, the snow forest which covers much of Russia and circles the globe.

“Then he found a dry place under a larch tree and slept there between the roots,” Regional head Sholban Kara-Ool said.

The whole village is throwing a party to celebrate his survival. He was given the second name of Mowgli.

The toddler had a small bar of chocolate in his pocket, and may have been following a puppy.

More than 100 people were involved in the search effort over day and night, while a helicopter traversed an area of 120 sq km.

After 72 hours in the wildnerness, he was eventually found on Wednesday in a makeshift bed.

Ayas Saryglar, the regional emergencies chief, told the Siberian Times that Tserin had survived a “very dangerous” ordeal.

'A case of mistaken identity': Jericho the lion was NOT killed,"JERICHO THE LION is alive and well, it has been confirmed.

Last night there were reports he had been shot dead by a poacher.

The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force (ZCTF) reported the lion was killed at 4pm yestrday.

However, the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority today said that Jericho is alive. The organisation also emphasised Jericho is a ‘coalition’ partner to Cecil, not a blood-related sibling.

Oxford’s Wildlfire Conservation Unit said: “Many people have asked if Jericho and Cecil were brothers. They were not related though their bond was one close to brotherhood.”

Male lions often form what are termed co-operative ‘coalitions’ with unrelated males in order to better compete with other males for territories and prides.

Brent Stapelkamp is monitoring Jericho as part of the Lion Research Project.

Cecil’s killing sparked an international outcry and Zimbabwean authorities called it an illegal hunt. The country is looking to extradite Walter Palmer, a US dentist who allegedly paid $50,000 (€45,000) to kill the lion.

A different lion

ZCTF apologised for its error, saying it had received three separate confirmed reports that Jericho.

“We apologize for reporting that he had died but were confident that our sources were in fact correct.” [sic]

The group claimed a different lion was killed.

“This was a case of mistaken identity, but a lion has in fact been killed. Although we are relieved that it was not Jericho, we are not happy that yet another lion has been killed.”

The Dublin Bus strike is OFF tomorrow and Wednesday,"THE DUBLIN BUS strike has been called off for tomorrow and Wednesday.

Unions said that workers agreed to suspend the planned 48 hours of stoppages in order to engage in discussions with Dublin Bus.

General Secretary of the National Bus and Rail Union (NBRU) Dermot O’Leary said that the union was “placing our trust” in the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) that progress could be made this week.

“In agreeing to suspend our member’s industrial action we are placing our trust in the WRC and its assessment, following its separate exploratory discussions with Dublin Bus, that significant progress can be achieved over the next number of days in order to find a resolution to this dispute,” he said.

A third strike this week scheduled for Saturday – when the All-Ireland Final replay will be held – has not been called off.

O’Leary said that that strike would depend on how talks go at the WRC throughout the week.

Dublin Bus confirmed that all services would operate as normal tonight and tomorrow.

“Dublin Bus management attended exploratory talks at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) today and will continue to engage with all parties at the WRC over the coming days in an effort to find a resolution to this current dispute,” the company said in a statement.

Transport Minister Shane Ross welcomed the decision to call off the strike today and tomorrow.

“Minister Ross welcomes the decision of Dublin Bus drivers to defer strike action to allow meaningful negotiations take place,” a statement from the minister reads.

He is cognisant of the relief this will bring to the travelling public, businesses and all those who have been adversely affected by the recent strikes.

Dispute

The dispute between both sides centres on pay, with Dublin Bus workers seeking a 15% pay increase over the next three years and a 6% rise they say they were due to get under an agreement in 2009, but which was deferred.

Unions last month rejected a Labour Court-recommended 8.25% increase over the next three years.

The company says that the strikes have already cost it €4 million and “continues to impact the financial stability of the company”.

Hundreds of thousands of commuters are affected each day by the stoppages.

Both the union and Dublin Bus management met today at the WRC to discuss the workers pay claims, ahead of the announcement that the stoppages were to be called off.

Both sides are due back at the WRC tomorrow morning at 10 o’clock.",https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-bus-strike-8-2997234-Sep2016/,the_journal,1

Ireland's Young Scientist winners come third overall in Europe,"THE WINNERS OF the BT Young Scientist & Technology Exhibition have come third in the European Union Contest for Young Scientists in Brussels.

Maria Louise Fufezan and Diana Bura received €3,500 for their efforts, and also won a trip to DuPont’s science and engineering plants in Denmark.

The fifth-year students from Loreto Secondary School, Balbriggan, represented Ireland at the European competition with their award-winning project, entitled:

An Investigation into the Effects of Enzymes used in Animal Feed Additives on the Lifespan of Caenorhabditis Elegans.

The project looks at the effect of animal feeds on soil fertility, and won them top prize at the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition in Dublin last January.

The project provides new evidence of potentially detrimental effects on the environment, a significant finding with implications for the food industry.

Speaking in Brussels, Maria-Louise and Diana said:

We are proud to be recognised on an international stage alongside so many talented young scientists and entrepreneurs from across Europe.

This experience, on the back of our win at the BT Young Scientist & Technology Exhibition in January, has given us a platform to share our ideas with the industry, build on our original research and potentially make a real difference to the environment.

Trinity College research could lead to 'novel treatment' for Alzheimer's,"Updated – 7:45pm

RESEARCHERS AT TRINITY College have shed light on a fundamental cause of Alzheimer’s disease which they say could lead to new form of therapy for those living with the condition.

Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia globally and affects up to 40,000 people in Ireland today. It is the fourth leading cause of death in individuals over the age of 65 and it is the only cause of death among the top ten that cannot be prevented, cured or even slowed down.

The research was published this week in leading international journal Science Advances. It involves a key characteristic of the disease – a build-up of a small protein called ‘amyloid beta’ in the brain of patients.

When the brain is unable to clear this protein, plaques build up and this is a major factor in the process of Alzheimer’s.

It is unclear how this protein is usually cleared but Trinity researchers found it can pass between the cells in blood vessels in the brain.

This could offer a new way of removing this protein from the brains of people who have Alzheimer’s.

“We’re quite excited that this could be a novel approach to treating or thinking about treating Alzheimer’s as an adjunct, as an additive therapy to the current therapies that are being developed,” commented Dr Matthew Campbell.

Working with the Dublin Brain Bank, which is based in Beaumont Hospital, the researchers from Trinity examined brain tissues of individuals who were affected by Alzheimer’s disease during their lifetime and then compared results to those observed in model systems in the laboratory.

The next steps now are to consider how periodic clearance of the protein through blood vessels might be achieved.

Szymon and Aga, originally from Poland but living in Tallaght, have been best friends since they met in college 16 years ago.

WHEN REALITY TV became a phenomenon, we probably didn’t think that eventually we’d watch people watching TV – but after it appeared in 2013, Gogglebox became somewhat of a phenomenon.

Now the series is set to begin in Ireland tonight, where we will see Irish families and friends sit around to discuss and dissect the latest TV programmes in front of the cameras.

In the UK, the show averaged between three and four million viewers a series, with a number of the ‘cast’ becoming household names. There was even a Brexit Special where the families talked about the EU referendum.

Hopes are high within TV3 that this success can be replicated in Ireland.

The 12-week series will see a range of Irish households taking part:

Fergal and Neal Tully: “These identical twins grew up on a farm in rural Cavan along with their three other brothers. They live a stone’s throw of one another and claim to chat with each other more than to their own wives. Although they rarely see eye to eye, the pair have never had an argument in their entire lives.”

To achieve that goal I today received sanction from Cabinet for up to an additional 610 SNA posts for allocation to schools from September.

Special Needs Assistant roles were cut quite significantly in the early years of austerity following the economic crash, both in terms of individual hours for affected students and also teaching resources.

Today’s announcement is a very definite reversal of that trend.

Details of the allocations are to be made available on the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) website from this evening.

Today’s allocation will see the number of SNAs in Irish schools increase to 11,820. As such, today’s allocation comprises an increase of 7.6%.

The EU has scrapped the 90-day limit on free roaming charges,"THE EU TODAY scrapped a 90-day limit to its landmark free mobile phone roaming policy, promising checks to curb abuse after the initial plan ran into fierce criticism.

At a news briefing, Andrus Ansip, EU Commission vice-president, and Commissioner for the Digital Single Market, said:

We will not put any kind of limits on duration or, how many days [travellers] can enjoy no roaming surcharges, but we decided to put some clear safeguards on residency.

The commission announced the original ‘free roaming’ plans with huge fanfare last year, but when it unveiled the details earlier this month consumer groups were outraged by a limit of 90 days of free roaming per year.

They had assumed the Commission’s pledge to end mobile roaming charges – additional costs when people use their phone outside their home country – meant exactly that, without conditions or caveats.

As a result, they responded angrily to the 90-day “fair use” limit, alleging that Brussels had caved in to the powerful telecoms companies for whom roaming charges have long been a lucrative source of extra income.

Instead of time limits, the new Commission proposal will allow operators to crack down on people whose phone usage abroad “significantly” outweighs their domestic calls.

It will also allow mobile operators to cancel SIM cards found to be used almost exclusively abroad.

The Commission’s proposal now goes to the EU’s 28 national regulators for negotiation, in order for the plan to be implemented by 15 June next year as originally promised.",https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-roaming-2989640-Sep2016/,the_journal,1
Eir is hiring 100 new people to work on the rollout of rural broadband,"A TOTAL OF 170 new jobs have been announced by broadband company eir and pharmaceutical company BioPharma.

Telecoms company Eir is hiring 100 staff to join its team involved in the rollout of high-speed broadband across the country.

The new positions will include poling crews, cabling technicians and fibre splicers.

Separately, BioPharma Engineering is creating 70 new jobs at its Dublin and Cork offices over the next three years.

KN Network Services – a supplier to eir – will recruit the 100 staff required. They expect to fill most of the roles, which will be based throughout the country, in the next three months.

Eir have already recruited 50 apprentices this year, and the company has committed to recruiting 300 apprentices over the course of the broadband rollout, starting in the coming months.

Carolan Lennon, Managing Director at open eir, said the partnership with KNNS is a critical component of the company’s broadband investment programme:

“eir has embarked on the largest telecoms investment project of its kind in Ireland,” said Carolan Lennon of ‘open eir’.

“To date, we have spent close to €400m alone on our high-speed fibre broadband rollout programme.”

Lennon said that KNNS is rolling out broadband to rural communities “by recruiting staff from rural Ireland”.

She also said eir is investing more in rural broadband than any other country.

Legal challenge

Damien Gallagher, the managing director of the KN Group said: “KNNS employs over 1,500 people throughout Ireland and sees at close hand the importance of high-speed broadband to rural communities.”

Eir say that have provided access to high-speed fibre broadband to 1.6 million home to date, and have committed to connecting a further 300,000 rural premises before 2020, using the company’s network of 1.5 million telephone poles.

They have, however, launched a legal challenge to their legal requirement to provide basic phone services in rural areas.

The firm say their plans will bring the number of homes and businesses with access to high-speed broadband to 1.9 million premises, roughly four out of every five homes and businesses.

The Government has separately promised high-speed broadband throughout most rural parts of Ireland under a five-year plan.

In the last three years, microbrewery beer production has increased by 550%.

According to the Irish Brewers’ Association (IBA) annual report in the last year, beer output has increased by 6% – rising from 730 million litres to 750 million litres.

Two years ago, Finance Minister Michael Noonan made special provisions for microbreweries in the Budget by increasing excise relief for the sector.

However, the Vintners’ Federation of Ireland said it was disappointed excise duty was not reduced last year, calling it “a missed opportunity”.

Excise relief

The annual excise relief production ceiling for microbreweries was increased from 20,000 hectolitres to 30,000 hectolitres.

“We are looking to build on those,” said Creed ahead of next month’s Budget.

We are always looking at ways to help the industry, but bear in mind it is an industry that is doing very well already. But we are conscious of the issues and the asks and we have had consultations with them on how we can assist.

He said the industry was experiencing impressive growth in recent years.

It is estimated that there are 63 microbreweries operating in Ireland, of which 48 are production microbreweries and 15 are contracting companies.

A 2015 report by the Independent Craft Brewers of Ireland found that 22 new production microbreweries commenced production in 2014. By end of year 2015, the total number of production microbreweries may have risen to approximately 58.

Craft beer producers

The turnover of craft beer producers in 2014 is estimated at €23 million and at a projected €39.6 million for 2015. Five microbreweries had a turnover of more than €1 million in 2014.

Creed said it is one of the areas that is performing well, which is positive news for tillage farmers.

We have a real issue in the tillage area. Tillage farmers have been really suffering for a number of years and I am very conscious of that and I am trying to work through with them on that.

That is one of the bright areas for the tillage sector because obviously they are a critical ingredient in the distillery and brewery business.

It is now a good news story, he added.",https://www.thejournal.ie/craft-beer-brewers-budget-2017-2982261-Sep2016/,the_journal,1
Boost for Ireland as Shane Long in line to return before Bosnia playoff,"Shane Long hopes to be fit for Ireland's playoff with Bosnia.

Shane Long hopes to be fit for Ireland's playoff with Bosnia.

SOUTHAMPTON MANAGER RONALD Koeman has handed Republic of Ireland manager Martin O’Neill a boost by claiming that Shane Long is close to a club return.

The Ireland international suffered an ankle injury during the 2-1 defeat to Poland earlier this month, but could yet feature in November’s playoff double header with Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Long will miss Southampton’s Premier League clash with Liverpool on Sunday but Koeman is optimistic he can return next weekend for the visit of Bournemouth on 1 November.

“Shane Long is still out at the moment,” Koeman told the club’s official website, “but he is progressing well.”

However, O’Neill will have to plan without midfielder Stephen Quinn for the November games, as the Reading midfielder has been forced to undergo knee surgery.

Royals boss Steve Clarke does not see the 29-year-old back in action until the new year.

“Stephen won’t be with us probably until end of December or January,” Clarke admitted. ”He’s had an operation that we were hoping we could avoid.

“But he’s had to go in and have surgery and we’re now looking at maybe 10 weeks from now until he’s back. It’s a blow for Stephen. But he’ll work diligently on his rehab and get himself ready.”",https://www.the42.ie/shane-long-hopes-to-be-fit-for-bosnia-2407959-Oct2015/,the_journal,1

the millionaire entrepreneur who's giving back,"JERRY KENNELLY HAS been self-employed his whole working life.

And sitting in his office on Dublin’s southside, he sells his passion for selling his passion.

Having sold his stock image company Stockbyte for over €100 million, he currently runs design company Tweak, but wants to pass on his passion for entrepreneurship.

To that end, Kennelly is the co-chair of the Junior Entrepreneur Programme (JEP).

JEP is a free 12-16 week programme for schoolchildren that is the only initiative that promotes entrepreneurship at primary level. Over the last five years, more than 26,500 national school pupils have already benefitted from the programme.

In his Kerry drawl, Kennelly outlines the importance of teaching children more than just the three Rs.

You can get children to open their minds to their potential. To make them see that it’s not all about working for someone else.

The project is obviously one that is close to Kennelly’s heart. Having grown up the son of a small business owner and starting his own business at 21, Kennelly is a firm believer in creating indigenous industry.

To that, he says, the country has to ensure that children are taught that they can be business owners.

I believe that entrepreneurship is in our DNA. We punch way above our weight internationally. We have an aptitude to make business happen.

Support

Kennelly has previously told a story of struggling to access credit for Stockbyte, but he understands that is the life of entrepreneur.

“You do have to sacrifice a lot and not everyone is able to that.

“When I’m mentoring people, I always ask them “are you up for it?” because it takes a lot to make it work. It takes an absolutely ridiculous amount of effort to make it work.

“It’s a very hard lifestyle.

“It’s a great lesson in humility!”

Citizenship

So, why not take the fruits of his labour and ride off into the sunset?

Where is the impetus to back children? For Kennelly, it’s about community. His family founded Kerry’s Eye and wrote extensively about the local area.

Allied to that is his admiration for the GAA, which he says “gets to grassroots” in every Irish community.

But mostly, it’s about contributing.

“I’m very proud to be Irish, I’m very proud to make a contribution to my community and other communities around the country along with my colleagues.

That’s what Ireland is all about. It’s just good enough to be a citizen, you’ve got to play a part, too.

“Everyone has to give the skills that they can share.

“I think JEP is a great example of teachers stepping outside their comfort zone.”

This year, 10,000 JEP students had combined sales of €250,000, with profits of €159,000.

“That’s 11- and 12-year-old children.

“If nothing else, it helps them make better informed choices about their own future.”

How's this for a Monday morning... Ireland's getting 200+ new jobs,"THERE ARE SET to be 200 jobs created in Clonmel, Co Tipperary over the next six months.

Eishtec, the Waterford-based customer service solution provider, will be creating the positions for workers who will be providing support to UK-based customers.

Recruitment for the positions will start immediately.

The company has been in operation since 2011 and has grown from having just 9 staff to employing 1,300 across sites in Waterford, Wexford and Craigavon.

RTÉ is reporting that an additional 76 jobs are set to be created with Bluefin Payment Systems, a US-based payment processing company, and CipherTechs, an information security service provider.

The new jobs created by Eishtec will be based in Clonmel in Co Tipperary.

Speaking about the launch today, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Richard Bruton applauded the company for bringing employment to the south-east, an area that has traditionally suffered from economic deprivation.

“Today’s announcement that it is establishing a third operation in the south-east, and bringing 200 jobs to Clonmel, a town with historical employment challenges, is another massive boost for the region,” he said.

Speaking about the new jobs, co-founding director of the company, Colm Tracey, said, “Our company mission is to challenge the standards of service and our employees are trained to the highest standards to do just that.",https://www.thejournal.ie/monday-morning-ireland-celebrate-new-jobs-tipperary-2315627-Sep2015/,the_journal,1
FAI obtain additional Euro 2016 tickets as fans begin to receive the good news,"Ireland fans are one of the top five countries to apply for Euro 2016 tickets.

Ireland fans are one of the top five countries to apply for Euro 2016 tickets.

THE FAI HAVE received an extra 832 match tickets for the Euro 2016 finals, it has been announced.

Yesterday it was revealed that Uefa would begin taking payment from those who were successful in their applications from this morning.

While many supporters took to social media and the YBIG forum to express their delight after the funds were extracted from their bank accounts, those left worrying should be aware that the process is likely to run into the weekend and early next week.

The FAI say they also have 2,000 tickets in reserve, which “will be used to satisfy the demand from supporters with a proven match attendance record, who have missed out on securing tickets through the Uefa Portal”.

And Ireland’s allocation has now risen from 32,502 to 33,334 after a letter was written to European football’s governing body.

“We are continually in talks and correspondence with UEFA for more tickets, and this policy has proven successful up to now,” said FAI chief John Delaney.

“There are still 2,000 extra tickets which we will draw on to try and satisfy those who have missed out on the current process.

I’d like to thank Uefa for its work so far in freeing up more tickets, but we, of course, would like more.

YOU CAN NOW use your Leap Card to use bikeshare service DublinBikes once you associate the transport card with your account on dublinbikes.ie

The initiative won’t allow people to pay for their Coca-Cola Zero dublinbikes trips from their Leap Card account, but will allow them to use the same card for the bikeshare as they use for the bus, Luas or Dart.

Your DublinBikes account remains the source for payment for annual memberships and three-day ticketing – and for each bike trip taken which incurs a cost.

To associate your Leap Card with your DublinBikes account:

Existing bikeshare members can log into their account at dublinbikes.ie to associate a LEAP Card with their existing account.

New members can log on to dublinbikes.ie where they will be requested to choose either Leap Card or a Coca-Cola Zero dublinbikes membership card.

A leap card can then be validated at any of the 101 bike stations across the city.

Enda Kenny and Joan Burton will be happy with the latest numbers

Updated 6.25pm

EMPLOYMENT IS NOW increasing at a rate of over 1,000 per week, according to the latest CSO figures.

The statistics agency’s latest Quarterly National Household Survey to the end of June shows there are now 1,958,700 people at work.

With 57,100 jobs added in the last year, employment in Ireland is now at its highest level in six years.

Over the last year the number of people who were unemployed declined by 43,300, with the latest monthly unemployment rate for July standing at 9.5 per cent.

Long-term unemployment is also declining having gone from 6.8 per cent to 5.5 per cent in the year to the end of June.

This means Ireland’s unemployment rate is now lower than the average rate across the 28 EU member states.

Average unemployment in the eurozone countries stands at 11.1 per cent by comparison.

The figures are good news for the government as politicians prepare for the resumption of the Dáil next month and October’s budget with a general election also due before April next year.

Concern over youth unemployment

The National Youth Council of Ireland’s deputy director James Doorley commented: “After a steady decline since 2012, from a high of 31% to 20% at the end of 2014, youth unemployment has drifted back up again in the last six months to over 22%.”

He added:

High youth unemployment, coupled with disappointing emigration figures – where the drop in those leaving was less than we had hoped with 30,400 15 to 24 year olds emigrating – mean that although the overall trends are positive, there is only marginal improvement and the high figures are still cause for concern

He said that “we should take this as a timely reminder that Government needs to intensify efforts to address youth unemployment”.

Indeed – a global jobs site – announced that it is looking to hire 300 new staff in Dublin over the next two years.

The roles, which are already being advertised, will be in a variety of departments within the company’s EMEA headquarters. They include jobs in sales, client services, business development, marketing, finance and operations.

There are currently 230 employees working from the Dublin offices.

According to the firm, the website operates in more than 50 countries and 28 languages. In Ireland, it attracts about 800,000 visitors per month.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny took some time out from schmoozing with Cook this morning to welcome the news.

He said indeed’s decision to expand, doubling employee numbers by 2017, was a “vote of confidence” in Dublin.

Tánaiste Joan Burton – also on hand to help out with the announcement – pointed to the importance of the site to jobseekers and employers.

While Jobs Minister Richard Bruton made clear that his had met several Indeed executives during trade missions to the US since 2011. The current expansion is supported by his department through IDA Ireland.

“A key part of our jobs plans is persuading fast-growing ‘born-on-the-internet’ companies to establish operations here so that Ireland can share in their growth from an early stage,” he said.

50 new jobs at award-winning 'Give Up Yer Aul Sins' animation studio,"Updated at 9.30pm

ONE OF IRELAND’S recent success stories in animation is to open a “new chapter” after being acquired by a major North American studio.

Brown Bag Films, which received Oscar nominations for Give Up Yer Aul Sins and Granny O’Grimm’s Sleeping Beauty, will keep its brand but will now be owned by Toronto-based 9 Story Media Group.

The Dublin-based animator says it now plans to take on 50 more staff to add to the 180 it currently employs as it takes advantage of 9 Story’s distribution power.

Brown Bag Films was founded in 1994 and is known for its 3D animation that is aimed primarily at children. It recently bagged three Emmy’s for its work on the 3D animation series Peter Rabbit.

In addition to its Dublin headquarters, Brown Bag Films has a 2D studio in Manchester as well as post-production facilities in Los Angeles.

As well as dreaming up its own productions, the company has also worked with some of the biggest animators in the world including Disney, Nickelodoan and the BBC.

9 Story is one of North America’s biggest animation studios, employing over 250 staff and creating some well known children’s cartoons like Arthur.

“This new chapter is the next logical step for us in our ongoing evolution and will ensure that audiences around the world get to watch more of the great shows they have come to expect from Brown Bag Films,” Gaffney said today.

Gaffney and O’Connell say that the decision to partner with 9 Story was taken after they explored “a range of options to take the company to the next level”.

For their part, the 9 Story Media Group were attracted to Brown Bag because of their reputation for “high quality animation”, says CEO Vince Commisso.

Pharmaceutical BioPark to create 500 full-time jobs and 800 construction jobs in Cork,"A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY has announced a €150 million investment in a new BioPark campus in Cork Harbour, creating 500 full-time jobs, plus 800 construction jobs.

The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Mary Mitchell O’Connor today announced the investment, which will feature four factories at the IDA’s site in Loughbeg, Ringaskiddy, Co. Cork.

GE BioPark Cork, subject to contract and planning approvals, will feature Europe’s first KUBio – prefabricated, off-the-shelf bio-manufacturing facilities, owned and run by GE’s biopharma customers.

The BioPark is expected to be home to more than 500 new jobs when fully operational – 400 with biopharma companies and a further 100 employed directly by GE. The construction phase, subject to planning approvals, is expected to begin by mid- 2017 and create up to 800 construction jobs.

GE said that patient demand for innovative medicines is driving rapid global growth of the biopharmaceutical industry, resulting in significant need for more production capacity.

GE Healthcare is a multinational employing 46,000 people worldwide, 600 of them in Cork.

They already have a global manufacturing site at Carrigtwohill in East Cork, which saw a €40 million investment in the plant – but in August they told local media in Cork they had to withdraw several dozen job offers, following an industrial relations dispute at the plant.

Emissions

The KUBios planned by GE are between 25-50% more cost-effective to build than traditional facilities.

They said the Co2 emissions can be reduced by up to 75%, while water and energy use can be reduced by around 80%. Build time can be shortened to 18 months from the usual three years.

“The biopharma industry makes a huge contribution to the Irish economy in terms of jobs and manufacturing exports, and is one of the fastest growing sectors,” said Minister for Jobs Mitchell O’Connor.

This is a further testament to our talented workforce. All investment and jobs created has a positive knock on effect on the wider region.Over 28,000 people currently work in biopharma and 6,000 of those work in biologics.

“This subsector is expected to double in the coming years and will provide both a challenge and an opportunity for the industry and training providers to collaborate on promoting the range of career opportunities available.”

Kieran Murphy, the chief executive of life sciences at GE Healthcare said that pharma companies worldwide are “racing to respond” to patient needs with new life-changing biological medicines.

We are delighted to be investing once again in Ireland, where we have ourselves a long history of manufacturing our own medical imaging products.

Seamus McGrath, the mayor of County Cork, and Tim Lucey, chief executive of Cork County Council, welcomed the announcement.

“The choice of Ireland, and especially Ringaskiddy, for this important investment by GE is a significant win for industry in the Cork Region and an endorsement of Cork as the leading location for such investment,” they said, in a joint statement.

The creation of more than 500 new jobs in the BioPark will be a huge boost in the region, they added.

IDA chief executive Martin Shanahan, said the location of the BioPark in Ireland was a “significant win”. He said:

Ireland has won more than €10 billion in the past 10 years in biotech investment.

In a separate development, GE and the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT) have a plan to create a centre of excellence at NIBRT’s Dublin facility, to train 1,500 bioprocessing professionals annually.

Dominic Carolan, chief executive of the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training, based in Dublin, said the development “will accelerate the introduction of these new technologies to the biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry,” increasing access to therapies.",https://www.thejournal.ie/cork-biopark-2986400-Sep2016/,the_journal,1
Irish Rail are making some big changes to the Dart and want to hear from you,"A NEW CONSULTATION process is underway that could see a big increase in the number of Dart services operating.

Public consultation has been launched for what would be a big expansion early next year.

It would see the intervals between services reduced from 15 minutes down to 10 minutes – meaning that commuters would be able to avail of six trains an hour.

Speaking about these potential changes, Minister for Transport Paschal Donohoe said that it would mean “less congestion on carriages at peak times and enhanced reliability, both of which will be welcomed”.

Over the past two years passenger numbers have grown from 36.7 million in 2013 up to 37.8 million in 2014.

What else could change?

It has also been proposed that there be a shift in the weekday start time for the Dart service.

These changes would see:

The Malahide service, which currently starts at 6.30am, moved back to 5.50am,

The Howth service, which currently starts at 6.05am, moved back to 6am,

The Bray service, which currently starts at 5.40am, moved back to 5.35am.

The new proposals also include changes to Irish Rail, and if successful passengers commuting from Dundalk and Belfast will see a shift in how frequently their trains operate.

The draft schedule includes changes to the timings of all services operating out of Connolly, although a lot of services will not see their frequency impacted.

What can the public do?

The draft schedules are currently online and members of the public are able to view them on the Iarnród Éireann website.

Great news for ex-Leinster man Ian McKinley as IRFU apply to goggles trial,"THE IRFU HAS applied to take part in World Rugby’s trial of Raleri’s protective goggles in rugby, meaning Ian McKinley will be free to play in Ireland if that application is accepted.

The former Leinster out-half, who lost sight in one eye after a training-ground accident in 2010, has been campaigning for the IRFU to take part in World Rugby’s trial.

The IRFU’s previous reluctance to be part of the trial had meant that McKinley was unable to play on Irish soil due to the fact that he now wears Raleri’s protective goggles when playing rugby.

Ex-Ireland U20 international McKinley retired from professional rugby in 2011 on account of the loss of sight in his left eye, but returned to the sport in 2014 after a move to take up a coaching position in Italy.

With the Italian federation part of the goggles trial, McKinley excelled for third division for Leonorso, earning a move to Viadana in Italy’s top division. He made his Guinness Pro12 debut for Zebre earlier this season, after joining as a permit player, but was unable to feature in an away match against Connacht.

McKinley’s campaign to have the IRFU reverse their stance on the goggles trial picked up major support from the rugby community in Ireland in recent months, with more than 13,000 people signing a petition on the subject.

The IRFU has now confirmed its application to participate in the ongoing World Rugby Raleri goggles trial, following a recommendation by the IRFU medical committee, who performed a thorough review of World Rugby trial data and updated advice given by independent medical experts.

The current restriction on goggles will remain in place until the IRFU has been confirmed as a participant in the World Rugby trial, although they hope the process will be completed early in 2016.

“If the IRFU is accepted onto the trial those seeking to wear goggles on the field must then apply to World Rugby to participate in the trial and purchase the Raleri goggles directly from the Italian manufacturer – in accordance with the terms of the trial, no other eyewear will be permitted,” reads the IRFU statement.

“The IRFU encourages parents, players, coaches and volunteers to review information available from World Rugby in relation to the trial.”

'I've had a lot of lucky escapes': This man has been going to matchmaking festivals for 70 years,"Mick Burke, centre, has been attending the Lisdoonvarna matchmaking festival for 70 years - and started out with ""no notion of getting married"".

Mick Burke, centre, has been attending the Lisdoonvarna matchmaking festival for 70 years - and started out with ""no notion of getting married"".

MICK BURKE ATTENDED his first Lisdoonvarna matchmaking festival with his mother in 1946, when he was a sprightly 23-year-old.

Seventy years on, the 92-years-old sheep farmer from Borrisoleigh, Co Tipperary is still hopeful he will meet the love of his life.

“I fell in love with the atmosphere, the music, the dancing – and of course the women. After that I was hooked, and have been coming back every year since, still hopeful I will meet someone.”

“I never married. I had a lot of lucky escapes. I fell in love with several women I met in Lisdoonvarna.

I used to go home with a pocketful of phone numbers – this was my fodder for the winter! I would go out on dates and to dances but had no notion of getting married.

“I had a few girlfriends over the years; once I was going out with a girl at home but I broke it off before I went to Lisdoonvarna – when I came back that was the end of that relationship.”

“Back then, Lisdoonvarna and the month of September were known as the farmer’s holiday – lots of bachelor farmers would come looking for a wife. There was a real rush to get the hay in so you can go to the spa, as it was known in those days. Lisdoonvarna was the place to go for a holiday and people would be looking forward to it all year.”

“There would be lots of women from America back then, looking for a rich farmer. I had 200 acre sheep farm.

Once I was dating a woman from Dublin and she came to visit me on the farm; it was particularly bad winter and we got snowed in for a few days. After the snow thawed she got straight on a train back to Dublin and that was the end of that. I think the remote location put a lot of women off.

“I always said that if I had met someone that would have been the end to my trips to Lisdoonvarna.

“You can’t bring an apple to the orchard and there is fun in kindling tobacco when you can smoke the pipe, he said.”

Over the years Mick met with matchmaker Willie Daly several times but no suitable matches were made. Willie said: “Mick was a very popular man with the ladies; he really didn’t need my help.”

Willie says that the success of the festival, which is 160 years old this year, is that it attracts young and old, and has a great, positive atmosphere: “where else in Ireland could you dance all day, every day for six weeks long?”",https://www.thejournal.ie/mick-burke-lisdoonvarna-2996924-Sep2016/,the_journal,1
The giant panda is no longer endangered in China,"Two one-month-old Pandas at the Chimelong Safari Park in Guangzhou in south China's Guangdong province.

Two one-month-old Pandas at the Chimelong Safari Park in Guangzhou in south China's Guangdong province.

DECADES OF CONSERVATION work in China have paid off for the giant panda, whose status was upgraded yesterday from “endangered” to “vulnerable” due to a population rebound, officials said.

The improvement for the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) was announced as part of an update to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, the world’s most comprehensive inventory of plants and animals.

The latest estimates show a population of 1,864 adult giant pandas. Although exact numbers are not available, adding cubs to the projection would mean about 2,060 pandas exist today, said the IUCN.

“Evidence from a series of range-wide national surveys indicate that the previous population decline has been arrested, and the population has started to increase,” said the IUCN’s updated report.

The cornerstones of the Chinese government’s effort to bring back its fuzzy, black-and-white national icon have included an intense effort to replant bamboo forests, which provide food and shelter for the bears.

Through its “rent-a-panda” captive breeding program, China has also loaned some bears to zoos abroad in exchange for cash, and reinvested that money in conservation efforts.

“When push comes to shove, the Chinese have done a really good job with pandas,” John Robinson, a primatologist and chief conservation officer at the Wildlife Conservation Society, told AFP.

“So few species are actually downlisted, it really is a reflection of the success of conservation,” he said at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, the largest meeting of its kind, which drew more than 9,000 heads of state, policymakers and environmentalists to Honolulu.

According to Simon Stuart, chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, the improvement was “not rocket science” but came from the hard work of controlling poaching and replanting bamboo forests.

“This is something to celebrate because it is not a part of the world where we expect this to happen,” Stuart told reporters at a press conference to unveil the updated Red List.

Experts warned, however, that the good news for pandas could be short-lived.

A warming planet, driven by fossil fuel burning, is predicted to wipe out more than one-third of the panda’s bamboo habitat in the next 80 years.

That means the panda population is projected to decline, and any gains realized to date could be reversed, said Carlo Rondinini, mammal assessment coordinator at the Sapienza University of Rome.

“The concern now is that although the population has slowly increased — and it is still very small — several models predict a reduction of the extent of bamboo forests in China in the coming decades due to climate change,” he told reporters.

The IUCN report said China’s plan to expand its conservation effort for pandas “is a positive step and must be strongly supported to ensure its effective implementation.”

The IUCN Red List includes 82,954 species, including both plants and animals.

Almost one-third — 23,928 — are threatened with extinction, it said.

A €500m investment yesterday and 300 jobs today,"LIMERICK WILL SEE 300 new jobs created over the next five years by a medical coding company.

Massachusetts-based firm Fazzi Healthcare Services is setting up a new healthcare services and coding centre in the city, it announced this morning.

Ministers lined up to welcome the development with Jobs Minister Mary Mitchell O’Connor and local TD Michael Noonan issuing statements through IDA Ireland.

The FDI agency’s own chief executive added, “This is terrific news for Limerick and for the entire region… There is a growing number of healthcare services located here and Fazzi, as the first company to engage in medical coding services in Ireland, is a positive addition to the life sciences profile of the midwest.”

Fazzi provides coding services to the American homecare and hospice sector.

Medical coding is the transformation of healthcare diagnoses, treatments, procedures, outcomes and services into universal medical alphanumeric codes, known as ICD.

Most countries, including Ireland, use this process to create codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances and external causes of injury or disease.

Today’s news comes after a €500 million investment in the city was announced on Monday.

Limerick Twenty Thirty Strategic Development, a special purpose vehicle set up by the local authority, has been tasked with delivering over €500 million worth of investment infrastructure across four strategic sites.

It is hoped the the venture will create more than 5,000 jobs over the next five years, transforming the city.

A statement said that Denis Brosnan, who previously led the giant Kerry group food business, will head up the Limerick Twenty Thirty company as executive chairman.

The firm will prioritise the redevelopment of 1.4 million sq ft of prime real estate across the four selected sites, and will look to deliver state-of-the-art office, retail, residential, education and commercial space.
