Permaculture has derived a set of principles to do this and one of its core practices is observation. Before we design and implement anything, we need to make time to observe. A dimension of observation is an understanding and immersion in ‘biotime’ – biological time.', 'Biotime runs at a very different pace and rhythm to human clock time. It involves the regular recording of events in the natural world. These can be as varied as the day the first spring bulb opens, the first autumn frost or the sighting of an unusual species of bird or insect in your local habitat. These occurrences can be part of a larger natural rhythm, like the turning of the seasons, or an indicator of slow changes in an ecosystem, like unusual weather patterns or an increase of average temperatures. This helps gardeners, farmers and nature watchers hone their observational skills.', 'Events can be as varied as the day the first spring bulb opens or the first autumn frost\n\t\t\t\t', 'We can also reflect on our own biological rhythms relating to the waxing and waning of the moon and the seasons and beyond.', 'The practice of sitting every day in the same place and widening our gaze, refining our listening skills, becoming aware of sound, smells, sights, and the ‘feeling’ of a place, engages our five senses and expands us into a 360-degree experience. We literally, with our senses, become engaged, expanded and more present.', '\n                            Observing ‘biotime’ can have physical and mental health benefits, research suggests.

There is evidence that exposure to nature can reduce hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure), respiratory tract and cardiovascular illnesses; improve vitality and mood; benefit issues of mental wellbeing such as anxiety; and restore attention capacity and mental fatigue.', 'Feeling a part of nature has been shown to significantly correlate with life satisfaction, vitality, meaningfulness, happiness, mindfulness, and lower cognitive anxiety. “When a person becomes connected to themself, to other people and to Nature, they become the greatest version of themselves,” as Jon Young from the 8 Shields Institute puts it.', 'The story of the day', 'After a daily biotime meditation in your regular spot, it is important to ‘tell the story of the day’.

Date a half page without a year or weekday, only the numerical day and month. Then fill in the year and beside, write your entry / observation. Year-on-year this enables you to refer back and begin to see emerging patterns in the events around you. It also allows you to identify the unusual phenomena like an early flowering of a plant weeks before it usually blooms or unusual constellations and alignments.', 'To encourage the keeping of such a log I have also produced a ready made biotime log beautifully illustrated by artist Jane Bottomley to help anyone create a fascinating record of their local environment and its rhythms and mysteries.', 'Feeling a part of nature has been shown to significantly correlate with life satisfaction, vitality, meaningfulness, happiness and mindfulness\n\t\t\t\t', 'Like Jon Young, I believe that nature connection connects us to ourselves, to others and to the ‘more than human world’.

How could a blueprint for wildlife-friendly farming take shape?', 'Henry Edmunds is excitedly identifying one butterfly after another as they flutter over his sheep-grazed, flower-rich Wiltshire downland. “You need to have a respect for life and be a proper steward of your land,” he says. “Industrial farming has lost that ethos; some farmers would clear all this, spray it with glyphosate to kill the lot, then plough it to grow barley. They’re silly asses,” he comments ruefully. Edmunds is not a farmer to pull his punches.', 'Brexit is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the four agriculture departments in the UK to design farm policies to replicate what Henry Edmunds has achieved: to support a vibrant farming sector that produces both quality food and a countryside richer in wildlife.', 'No longer should our lowland farms be so industrialised that they elbow out every flowering plant, the buzz of insects and seed-eating birds once commonplace. There are more sensitive ways of farming.', 'Jake Freestone, farms manager on the Overbury Estate in the Cotswolds, is one of the people trying. He has planted a mix of arable flowers including cornflowers and poppies in wide margins around the edges of many of his fields. In these fields, spring barley, oil seed rape and peas grow. The margins are left unsprayed and cut in the autumn to regrow the following year.\xa0 He wants to put the colour back into what would otherwise be a decidedly uniform farmed landscape.', 'And recent studies suggest that he’s on the right track: research shows that such margins can actually increase the yield of the main crop because they support so many pollinators and predatory insects that kill crop pests.', '\n                            Henry Edmunds in his flower and insect-rich pasture.

In my view, area payments (farm subsidies), that are currently paid to every farmer, need to be phased out and the money invested in agri-environment schemes, which pay farmers to manage their land for wildlife, as well as for other ‘goods’ such as improved public access and for reducing pollution from manure and fertilisers. In our uplands, where rain runs off heavily grazed land all too quickly, better downstream flood control would be another gain. Schemes like this are available to some farmers now but the CAP budget for them is dwarfed by subsidy payments. Consequently, only a minority of farmers can sign up.', 'Brexit could re-establish a farming ethic that has long faded: land husbandry not land exploitation\n\t\t\t\t', 'Under my vision, no lowland farmer would then receive any cash support unless they enter such a scheme. I would make entry compulsory – though our governments probably won’t – and based on a farm plan that would be drawn up with the farmer. This would avoid a ‘pepper pot’ effect in which one or two farms improve their land for wildlife within a sea of otherwise intensively managed crops in farms nearby. We need species to be able to move, and that includes plants that reproduce via seed dispersal, especially with climate change on our doorstep.', 'In the uplands, I favour retaining area payments, though much reduced – with agri-environment money added for habitat creation.

The more sophisticated Malagasies who do own latrines call it ‘going au natural’.', 'But latrines aren’t a hygienic solution either, and not only because they smell and are hard to keep clean. Madagascar has so much groundwater that many Antananarivo residents grow rice in their yards. When torrential rains hit, everything floods. The waste from latrines rises and floats into the yards, houses, shops and streets. The threat is very real. In a neighbour’s latrine across the street, the sordid grey goo almost reaches the pit’s surface, a clear menace come the next storm. “When we used the pit latrine before, and it rained, sometimes the water would come out,” Rartjarasoaniony tells me. “And we were afraid of getting sick because of the filth.”', '2.4 billion people lack access to basic toilet facilities, and nearly 1 billion can’t even do their business in private', None, 'In many places building a flushing toilet system, as we know it, is nearly impossible. Some places simply don’t have enough water. Some have too much, which complicates water treatment processes because of floods and overflows. Others don’t have the means to build the water-based infrastructure. That’s why Loowatt, a London-based startup, came up with a radically different flushing solution – one that doesn’t use water at all.', 'In Loowatt’s waterless flush design, the waste is sealed into a biodegradable bag underneath the toilet with not a drop of water being spilled. Once full, the bag is replaced by a service team, and the waste is brought (yes, hand-delivered) to Loowatt’s pilot waste-processing facility, where it’s converted to fertiliser and biogas.', None, 'This very manual setup sounds very archaic compared to the slick and convenient arrangements of the Western world. But sanitation experts think that in the era of climate change, when droughts and floods are becoming increasingly common, the West may have something to learn from the little waterless loos piloted in penniless Madagascan neighbourhoods. With the world’s population ever-increasing, places that historically relied on water for sanitation may have to reconsider how they flush.', 'A whole new loo', 'Loowatt’s London-based founder and CEO Virginia Gardiner never thought she’d end up designing 21st-century toilets. When she graduated from Stanford University in 1999 with a bachelor’s degree in comparative literature, she couldn’t have been further removed from the engineering challenges of processing human waste. But then she went to work as a reporter for an architecture and design magazine, Dwell, covering industry events. “I was the youngest on the edit team. Nobody else wanted to go to the kitchen and bath industry shows, so I did,” she recalls. One of the things that struck her was that architectural concepts evolved constantly, except for toilets, which seemed to remain the same for ever.', '“The first article I wrote for the magazine was about toilets – about the fact that they don’t change,” she says. She came to see the overall ‘bath culture’ as wasteful and decided toilets were due for an upgrade.', None, 'More funding followed, including from Innovate UK, the GSMA Mobile for Development Utilities Programme and, more recently, a RELX Group Environmental Challenge award. Serendipitously, a Canadian expat living in Madagascar learned about Gardiner’s project from her online video and became Loowatt’s first investor. That was the reason Loowatt launched its first single-toilet pilot and a small waste-processing facility in an impoverished Antananarivo neighbourhood.', 'The project killed two birds with one stone – giving people a toilet, and converting their waste to biogas, generating enough electricity to charge cellphones. When that proof of concept worked, Loowatt scaled up to its current size – 100 toilets serving about 800 customers.', 'In their basic appearance, Loowatt toilets don’t look much different from our Western johns, with their plastic seats and flushing handles, which come in the form of a pedal or a rope you pull. But instead of releasing a swirl of water into the basin, this move activates the white biodegradable film that envelopes and seals the waste, pushing it into a collector underneath the toilet, all odour-free. Loowatt’s service team replaces the biodegradable bag once a week, or more often if it fills up sooner.', 'With this toilet I feel safe and secure', 'Equipped with a small pushcart and collection bins, a two-person team conducts daily walks through the neighbourhood, gathering waste bags and doing repairs. The residents can also request service by text message when the bag fills up or if something breaks.', 'The Loowatt setup isn’t free – residents pay about £12 as a deposit for a toilet (which remains Loowatt’s property) and about £3 a month for service. For Madagascar, where some families exist on £1 a day, this isn’t cheap. But Rartjarasoaniony tells me she finds it acceptable. Maintaining a latrine costs more. “We have to empty it every six months, and it is really expensive,” she explains, not to mention the unsightly mess it creates. The manual process is done by ‘informal emptiers’ – usually men who show up with buckets to chug the goo into containers, dropping splotches of repugnant gunk around the yard for her egg-laying hens to peck at.', 'Standing behind Loowatt’s technician Edonal Razanadrakoto, I watch him tinker with Rartjarasoaniony’s toilet flushing mechanism. “In the older version of the toilet you had to push a pedal to make the bag seal the waste,” he explains, pointing at the plastic cogs and wheels. That mechanism ultimately relied on an internal rope, which often jammed and tore, so Loowatt switched to a sturdier, hand-pulled device, and now the toilets have to be upgraded. While Razanadrakoto changes the part, his coworker stashes the waste bag from underneath the toilet into a white bin on his pushcart and taps on the phone to update Loowatt’s online monitoring system: bag removed.', 'As we leave, Andriamahavita, the Loowatt manager, says that another neighbour also wants to talk. “She was about to go to work, but heard we were in the neighbourhood, so she waited,” he explains.', 'Sporting a white shirt and long braided hair, 43-year-old Gloria Razafindeamiza greets us in front of her house, next to her Loowatt toilet cabin, which is woven from recycled plastic. Only a few steps away on the ground a pressure cooker atop a charcoal burner simmers vary – rice, which locals eat three times a day. As Razafindeamiza explains her ordeals with the Malagasy way of using the toilet, a range of expressions crosses her face, from embarrassment to disgust. She works for the Ministry of Health, Andriamahavita explains, and really hates the unsanitary side of it all. A renter who moved here recently, she had to share an outhouse with several neighbours, some of whom didn’t clean up after themselves, leaving it unusable.', 'It was also too far from her house, which made things difficult. “If diarrhoea comes up at night, I’m afraid to go there,” she says. “Sometimes you would go there and it would be really dirty and you’d have to clean it before you could use it.” Electricity isn’t always available in Antananarivo either, so imagine doing all that in the dark. “With this toilet I feel safe and secure,” she adds.', 'Toilets of the future must operate off the grid, without access to water, electricity or sewage plants, and fit into poor urban settings', 'As we leave her yard, I steal a glance at Razafindeamiza’s living room through the window, which, like many other houses here, doesn’t have glass in the panes. The room looks nice, with teak furniture, a TV and pictures of Santa Claus and Dora the Explorer on the walls. But at the gates, we hop over a ditch that carries wastewater out of the house and into the gutters on the street. The ditch is full of a stagnant greyish fluid that stinks of rotten food and probably of faeces too. By now I am so immune to these smells that I can’t tell if it’s just muddy water or a recent overflow from a latrine. As de los Reyes, who studies faecal sludge management, once said: “In the developing world, people are surrounded by shit, often unbeknownst to them.”', 'Later, as Andriamahavita is driving us from Loowatt’s pilot neighbourhood to the main office, I can’t help but ask: “Gloria works for the Ministry of Health, and her house looks rather nice, so why can’t she afford a home with a better toilet?”', '“A government job doesn’t necessarily pay a lot of money,” Andriamahavita explains, but the biggest problem is the infrastructure. “We don’t really have a sewage system like in the Occident.” Middle-class Malagasies can afford certain life perks, like a TV, a stereo system, a smartphone, even a second-hand car. But a flush toilet isn’t something an individual’s money can buy.', 'A flush toilet needs a sophisticated set of underground pipes linking it to a facility that can digest its output – a sewage plant that cleans the water, releasing it back into the rivers and oceans, and re-processes the so-called biosolids into fertiliser safe to put onto fields.', 'It takes the entirety of society to make sanitation work \xad– an individual cannot master that challenge alone. Canadian epidemiologist David Waltner-Toews, author of The Origin of Feces, says it’s because humans have a very complicated relationship with their own waste.', 'A brief history of toilets', 'A pile of shit begins to endanger humans almost immediately. Attracted to the nutrients inside that pile – phosphorous, nitrogen and undigested proteins \xad\xad– pathogens swarm in. Some feed on it, others lay eggs. To stay healthy, we must keep the poo, which we produce regularly, as far away from ourselves as possible.', 'When our ancestors were nomadic they had it easy. They simply relieved themselves where they felt like and walked away from their precarious deposits. Sometimes they’d come back to where they took a dump last season to find fruit and berries growing, and make a connection that poo helps sprout food. When humans settled and began farming, they could no longer walk away from their poo, so they began to distance themselves from it, by accumulating it in pits, dumping it into rivers or shovelling it onto fields.', 'When people began to move into cities, space became scarce and waste disposal got ugly. Waltner-Toews says that in medieval Europe people emptied their chamber pots out the window. But generally, crowded living conditions prompted humans to become more creative in getting the unwanted matter out of sight and out of mind.', None, 'The ‘downstream’ approach was often the method of choice. Ancient Romans built communal bathrooms with rows of thrones akin to ours, only rather than commenting on Facebook posts, the toilet-goers probably discussed matters sitting next to each other, butt to butt; meanwhile the waste would fall into a gutter with continuously flowing water that carried it outside of the city walls by way of simple sewage routes.', None, 'There’s even evidence that some of our Neolithic ancestors flushed: in Skara Brae, a Stone Age village in Scotland, every dwelling had a primitive form of hydraulic toilet. But the first flush toilet that used mechanical levers to run the water was invented by English writer and poet Sir John Harington, who built one in his home and another one in the palace of Queen Elizabeth. Later, an English plumber named Thomas Crapper developed that invention into a more modern loo.', 'The Industrial Revolution and urban development locked the process of excrement removal into pipes and treatment plants, which treated sewage to levels that made it safe enough to release back into the world. That worked well for the 19th and 20th centuries, Waltner-Toews says, but rather than truly solving the problem, it scaled it to an industrial size. Treatment plants rely on a steady supply of water, which is not universal. The plants don’t recover enough nutrients from the sludge, so leftover phosphorus and nitrogen trickles into the water, helping to cause algal blooms. The ‘downstream’ solution just doesn’t work on a crowded planet, Waltner-Toews says. “In the 21st century, everybody is downstream from somebody else.”', 'For less than the cost of a coffee each month, you can help change the news for good. Become a Positive News supporter member from just £1 a month', 'For all these reasons, the Gates Foundation issued their Reinvent the Toilet Challenge, which called for more than just a clean removal of waste. Toilets of the future should recover ‘valuable resources’ from the waste, namely energy, nutrients and clean water. They must operate off the grid, without access to water, electricity or sewage plants, and fit into poor urban settings. And yet, they should be attractive enough for the high-income world to use.', 'This last requirement makes sense: in a world where every appliance is becoming smarter by the day, sanitation systems have to catch up. It was much easier for Mother Nature to clean up after the 300 million or so folks that lived on our planet 2,000 years ago compared to the 7 billion that live here today, or the 9 billion that will live here by 2050. And the waste we produce will keep piling up.', 'Sanitation is such a hot issue that there’s now an international conference in faecal sludge management, or FSM, aimed at keeping the world clean of the crap humans produce. And for good reason – without an organised waste-disposal system, society is basically doomed to languish in poverty and disease.', 'Open defecation, for example, is dangerous for several reasons. One is that woods and fields can be unsafe, especially in the dark and especially for women and children, because of everything from crime to poisonous snakes. But the other problem is that it creates huge health hazards.', None, None, None, 'Building designated waste repositories like latrines doesn’t make waste disappear either. Where space is plenty, people can just close off a full latrine and dig another hole. But when space is tight, like in crowded Antananarivo, where families are forced to share latrines, someone has to take out the trash. In Madagascar it’s usually men equipped with buckets. In Ethiopia it’s also men, who pour kerosene onto the waste to mask the smell and drink heavily before descending into the pit to dull their senses. But in India it’s often women of the lowest caste, the Dalits, who empty the pits – by scooping the waste into woven baskets, which they carry away on their heads, teaching their young daughters to do it too.', 'The amount of pathogens that can dwell in that sludge is mind-boggling: those responsible for hepatitis A and B, cholera, campylobacter, dysentery and salmonella, plus intestinal worms that you don’t even have to ingest to get sick – you can inhale them. From research samples taken from latrines all over the world, de los Reyes has seen all of that and more. He has been vaccinated and routinely takes a de-worming pill after gathering samples, just to be on the safe side. But most people who empty latrines, or have their latrines emptied and have droppings left in their yards, don’t have access to de-worming pills, and many don’t have the immunisations either.', 'Even when there is a public sanitation system, faecal sludge is often not treated to the appropriate standards before it is put back into the environment. In Dhaka, Bangladesh, only 2 per cent is treated acceptably, the rest just gets dumped out there, de los Reyes says.', None, 'The waste from Antananarivo homes that do have a flush toilet ultimately ends up in the city’s lake. From a distance, the lake looks pretty. Young couples walk along the water tapping on cellphones, but when I get near it, I have to hold my nose, overwhelmed by the stink. The lake smells worse than the ditch outside Razafindeamiza’s house.', 'Giving every teenager a phone is easy, in the sense that cell towers are fairly simple to install. But processing poo is a much stickier problem. To shape shit into something harmless and useful takes a very concentrated effort.', 'Hyperlocal poo processing', '“This area is considered contaminated, you should wear a mask,” sanitation worker Tojoniaina Andriambololona warns me as I enter an enclosure on Loowatt’s waste-processing site. The mask is a must – I will be exposed to the fresh poo collected this morning, along with everything that’s already germinating in it.', 'Nestling on a cliff overlooking mud houses and mango trees, the site occupies around 400 square metres and consists of a series of tanks linked by numerous pipes. At the system’s heart is the biodigester – a tank of nearly 30 cubic metres that converts poo produced by 800 or so people into about six tonnes of liquid fertiliser a month, sold to farmers. Three tonnes are sold as liquid fertiliser, with the remaining three being turned into one tonne of compost and 500 kg of vermicompost – nutrient-rich natural fertiliser chewed through by earthworms. Diversifying fertiliser products helps sell them, says Armel Segretain, a Loowatt engineer who moved from London to Antananarivo to oversee the implementation of the new sanitation model.', 'Compared to Western industrial treatment plants, this pilot operation is tiny, but its waterless setup significantly reduces the amount of sludge it must process. It also works on different chemical and biological principles than most Western plants.', 'In established industrial sanitation systems, water constitutes about 95 per cent of the overall sewage mass. This waste must be filtered and purified with chemicals before being released back into the environment. Then they treat the remaining biosolids, Segretain explains. But Loowatt toilets produce much less fluid. Another big difference is that Loowatt adds food leftovers to the process, which industrial treatment sites don’t do.', 'And, the majority of industrial treatment plants use an aerobic process, pumping oxygen through the faecal sludge to support the bacteria that eat it. These bacteria emit carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Loowatt instead uses anaerobic digestion – processing waste with bacteria that don’t use oxygen and produce methane, or biogas, which can be used as an energy source. Some carbon dioxide is still released, but in smaller amounts. “We have about 35 per cent of carbon dioxide in the gas we produce and 65 per cent methane,” Segretain says. A good ratio, he adds.', 'If we’re trying to make growing and eating food a local issue, then why not our poo processing too?', 'Just as with collecting it, loading waste into the digester is a manual task. Inside the contaminated chamber, Andriambololona loads white bags into a poo-extraction machine. I prepare to hold my nose, but the rambling apparatus lets out surprisingly little odour. Outside, hiding from the blistering sun in a shady spot, two workers load food leftovers brought from local restaurants into a machine that resembles an oversized meat grinder. It works like one too, slowly mushing rice and veggie bits into a soppy slush that drips into a bucket in grey soggy glops.', 'The poo and slush are then loaded into a pre-digester tank and heated to 70°C to kill pathogens. To comply with Gates Foundation requirements, the pre-digester relies on self-generated energy – the hot water used in the heating is itself heated by the biogas the system produces. The pasteurised matter is then pumped into the biodigester. It’s covered with a huge inflatable bag that collects the methane released. As the gas builds up, the bag floats up in the air, like an enormous balloon. When the bag is full, it’s actually larger than the digester itself, Andriambololona says.', 'To make the manual waste collection work, Andriamahavita tells me, the digester site had to be ‘hyperlocal’ \xad– very close to the neighbourhood where the toilets were installed, which was hard, as space is a real issue in Antananarivo. Gardiner says that the biggest challenge was orchestrating the manual waste-collection process, something that people aren’t generally used to in either the East or West. “What makes it hard to scale our technology rapidly is that it’s hard to support,” she says. “We have to have an operating service.”', 'But after getting the logistics of waste collection working for the 100-toilet pilot, Loowatt is getting ready to scale up. “Our objective basically is to be the main sanitation provider for the whole city of Antananarivo, probably in five to ten years,” says Segretain. To be an economically sustainable business there, Loowatt needs to service about 5,000 customers, which is the target for the next two years. Gardiner thinks Loowatt can reach double that number by 2019, something she sums up as “ambitious but possible”.', 'Does Loowatt’s approach have the potential to change how the world processes its waste? The company is working on introducing the concept to other countries – in Africa, Asia and Europe. In the UK, for example, Loowatt toilets are already being used at festivals and outdoor events, generating good revenue. “Here in Madagascar, the average price we can charge people to use our toilets is £3 a month,” Segretain says. “In the UK, with our festival toilets, if people pay as they go, they pay £3 per use. It’s a completely different scale.”', 'For now, Loowatt’s UK-generated waste ends up at existing industrial treatment plants, not little hyperlocal biodigesters, as in Antananarivo, pumping out compost. But, for Waltner-Toews, the idea of waste processing becoming more local is not that far-fetched.', 'Just like we have realised that food is best produced and consumed locally, we might scale down our waste-processing facilities to mediate what he calls the “redistribution of nutrients on the planet”. When we continuously transport corn from South America, tomatoes from Israel and strawberries from California to other locales, we alter the nutritional balance of those ecosystems. “You’re taking all this biodiversity out of one ecosystem and creating these piles of shit somewhere else,” Waltner-Toews says. And because we don’t ship our poo back to where the food came from, we deplete soils in some places and over-enrich others. So if we’re trying to make growing and eating food a local issue, then why not our poo processing too?', None, 'While it’s unlikely that every Western toilet will eventually have a biodigester attached to its bottom, or that little poop-collecting carts will roam the streets of London, Paris or New York, change isn’t impossible. Perhaps some places will be able to have machine-based food and faecal waste collection to feed an anaerobic neighbourhood digester that chugs out compost for urban farms.', 'The push to reinvent our waste processing is happening worldwide, with universities and startups working on alternative approaches. Some are using solar power to run electrochemical reactions to break down waste. Some are converting it to biochar – briquettes that can be burned in stoves to cook food. Others are focusing on improving the existing flush toilet systems by extracting and purifying water, or recycling it back to the toilet for more flushing. Some of these new systems favour an anaerobic approach, others use oxygen, but they all look for alternatives to our existing industrial solutions, which don’t reflect 21st-century needs.', 'At the end of the site visit I realise that, after several hours of talking toilets, I could really use one myself. Conveniently, there’s a Loowatt nearby. Remembering Razanadrakoto’s talk about broken ropes, I double-check the lever that makes the biofilm seal the waste. The white film moves inside the basin with a faint whoosh and I feel confident to get down to business.', 'Sitting on a Loowatt loo feels no different to sitting on my toilet at home in New York City – except when I look up there’s no roof, just a man standing in a mango tree, shaking the branches to release the fruit. As with regular toilets, sitting on a Loowatt seems to put you in a pensive mood. It occurs to me that I may be contributing to the man’s next harvest this very moment.', 'The peach tree in my own backyard would benefit from a similar contribution, I think, but New York’s sanitation system has no way of achieving that. I wonder if my home will ever feature a toilet of the future, capable of converting my waste into a food source for my trees. I pull the lever. Above me, in the mango tree, the man climbs ever higher, reaching for the fruit just beyond his reach.', None, None, 'Instead of being owned by a media mogul, Positive News is owned by the many.

How Rwanda could be the first country to wipe out cervical cancer - Positive News - Positive News,"['The east African country’s campaign to end cervical cancer through the HPV vaccine has had to overcome cultural taboos and rumours about infertility – but it’s saving lives', 'The east African country’s campaign to end cervical cancer through the HPV vaccine has had to overcome cultural taboos and rumours about infertility – but it’s saving lives', 'Girls began queuing at their local school with their friends, waiting for their names to be called. Many were apprehensive. After all, most of them had not had a vaccination since they were babies. It was 2013 and a new vaccine had arrived in Kanyirabanyana, a village in the Gakenke district of Rwanda. Reached by a reddened earth road, the village is surrounded by rolling hills and plantations growing crops from bananas to potatoes. Unlike the 10 vaccines already offered to young children as part of the country’s immunisation programme, this vaccine was different: it was being offered to older girls, age 11–12, in the final year of primary school.', 'Three years before, Rwanda had decided to make preventing cervical cancer a health priority. The government agreed a partnership with pharmaceutical company Merck to offer Rwandan girls the opportunity to be vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer.', 'This was the first time an African country had embarked on a national prevention programme for cervical cancer. Could Rwanda become the first country in Africa to eliminate it?', 'It was an ambitious goal. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in Rwandan women, and there were considerable cultural barriers to the vaccination programme – HPV is a sexually transmitted infection and talking about sex is taboo in Rwanda. Added to this, rumours that the vaccine could cause infertility made some parents reluctant to allow their daughters to be vaccinated.', 'Rwanda’s economy and history also made it seem an improbable candidate for achieving high HPV vaccination coverage. After the 1994 genocide, it was ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world. High-income countries had only achieved moderate coverage of the HPV vaccine; if the United States and France couldn’t achieve high coverage, how could Rwanda?', 'Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women. There were an estimated 570,000 new cases in 2018 – and more than 310,000 deaths, the vast majority in low-and middle-income countries. Sub-Saharan Africa has lagged behind the rest of the world in introducing the HPV vaccine and routine screening, which means the cancer often isn’t identified and treated until it has reached an advanced stage.', 'Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV. It is one of the commonest sexually transmitted infections globally, and most of us are infected with at least one type of genital HPV at some point in our lives – usually as teenagers or young adults. In most cases the virus is harmless and resolves spontaneously without causing any symptoms such as genital warts.', 'There are more than 100 strains of HPV, at least 14 of which can cause cervical cancer and a range of less common cancers, including of the penis, vagina and anus. Persistent infection with two strains of HPV, 16 and 18, is responsible for 70 per cent of cervical cancer cases.', 'The first vaccine against HPV became available in 2006. This was the culmination of decades of work, notably by scientists in Germany, who in 1983 discovered the link between HPV infection and cervical cancer.', 'Ian Frazer and Jian Zhou at the University of Queensland, Australia, then jointly developed the technology that enabled the HPV vaccine. Using recombinant DNA technology, they built the shell of the virus from scratch and made an ‘empty’ human papillomavirus in the lab.', '“This was something nobody had achieved before,” Frazer says. They realised this empty, non-infectious HPV could be used as a vaccine to prevent HPV and cervical cancer.', 'The news that there was a new vaccine which could drastically reduce the number of women getting cervical cancer went around the world. But with the excitement about the new vaccine came the realisation that not all girls would have the same opportunity to receive it. It was likely that at least a decade would pass between its introduction in high-income countries and in low-income countries.', 'Today there are three HPV vaccines – Gardasil and Gardasil 9, made by Merck, and Cervarix, made by GSK. All are highly effective at preventing infection with virus types 16 and 18. The newest – Gardasil 9 – was licensed in 2014 and protects against nine types of HPV, which between them cause around 90 per cent of cervical cancers.', 'More than 800,000 people died in the Rwandan genocide, and its widespread destruction left the country devastated. Coverage of most World Health Organization-recommended childhood vaccinations plummeted to below 25 per cent. But within 20 years, the number of babies in Rwanda receiving all recommended vaccinations, such as polio, measles and rubella, had increased to around 95 per cent. Rwandans’ life expectancy more than doubled between 1995 and 2011. The Rwandan government had demonstrated the determination and thoroughness of its approach to vaccinations. Could it now have the same success with HPV?', 'Before the HPV vaccine arrived in Kanyirabanyana, 63-year-old Michel Ntuyahaga, a community health worker, spent weeks canvassing his village, going to each of the 127 mud-brick houses to inform parents about the upcoming vaccination campaign.', 'Joined by a nurse, he explained to parents that if they had an adolescent daughter, they had an opportunity for her to be vaccinated against a deadly women’s disease – cervical cancer.', '“I explained to parents that the cancer is a disease and that the one measure to prevent it is vaccination,” he says.', 'Ntuyahaga wasn’t the only person educating the community about the vaccination campaign. Constantine Nyiransengiyera has been a primary school teacher in Kanyirabanyana for the past 13 years. In addition to teaching maths, science, French and English, she was – and continues to be – responsible for gathering all the 12-year-old girls at the local school to educate them about the HPV vaccine.', 'Silas Berinyuma, a leader in Kanyirabanyana’s Anglican church for the past 24 years, preached about the importance of the vaccine for weeks before it arrived in the village. The church used drama to depict scenes of cervical cancer’s devastating impact. This continues today.', 'The same awareness campaign was taking place around the country – Rwanda has a network of 45,000 community health workers, volunteers who are present in every village. Bugesera is a district in the Eastern province, not far from the border with Burundi. Billboards line roads through the district, advertising soft drinks alongside public health messages. One says: “Talk to your children about sex, it may save their lives.”', 'Not far off the main road is Karambi, a village surrounded by banana plantations. Toddlers roll tyres down the red-earth roads, teenagers carry handfuls of firewood on their heads, and adults herd cows and goats.', 'In 2013, the then 12-year-old Ernestine Muhoza was vaccinated against HPV at her school. “The teachers called just girls for assembly and told us that there was a rise of a specific cancer among girls aged 12 and that it was time for us to get vaccinated,” she says.', 'The Rwandan government had demonstrated the determination and thoroughness of its approach to vaccinations. Could it now have the same success with HPV?\n\t\t\t\t', 'When she went home to tell her parents about the vaccination, they’d already heard about it on the radio and via community health workers.', 'Muhoza’s parents readily agreed. But not every parent did. Some were sceptical. Why, they wondered, would their girls be getting vaccinated now, at this age? Why couldn’t all girls and women receive the vaccine? And rumour had it that the vaccine would make girls infertile.', 'Community health worker Odette Mukarumongi worked tirelessly in Karambi to counteract the rumours. “I told parents that a girl will go into constant menstruation – like endless bleeding – if she gets cervical cancer,” she says.', 'Mukarumongi\xa0says parents eventually “surrendered” and allowed their daughters to be vaccinated. Today, she says, parents rarely refuse, now that they can see the widespread acceptance of it in the community.', 'In Kanyirabanyana, Ntuyahaga worked similarly hard to convince parents that the vaccine wouldn’t stop their daughters from being able to conceive.', '“Parents had heard that the vaccine made girls infertile. We struggled to explain to them it wasn’t true – that it was better to vaccinate their daughters against the cancer because if they got it they would become infertile,” he says.', 'Community health workers and nurses visited homes with posters of women’s reproductive organs to show parents the damage cervical cancer could do to their daughters.', 'Felix Sayinzoga, manager of the maternal, child and community health division at the Ministry of Health, says: “Rwandans are really afraid about cancer so it was easy [to roll the vaccine out]. It was also about the trust the community has in the government. That was really important – the community knows that we do not bring things that are not good for them.”', 'The current health minister, Diane Gashumba, agrees that trust in the government has been critical in supporting the vaccine’s uptake, but admits that the rumours surrounding it were difficult to quash.', '“The rumours were not anticipated. But, of course, as the HPV vaccine was a new vaccine for a new target group there were many questions.” She adds that church and village leaders, community health workers and radio programmes played an integral role in dispelling myths about the vaccine.', 'Despite the vaccine’s potential to save lives – millions of them – HPV vaccination has been mired in controversy and hostility, and this has heightened in recent years.', 'Not a straightforward solution', 'The vaccine is recommended for girls, and in some countries for boys aged 12 to 13 too, because this is before sexual activity begins, bringing the risk of exposure to HPV. This has resulted in the vaccine being linked with promiscuity – a belief that vaccinating young girls against an STI sexualises them and encourages sexual activity. There is no evidence that boys or girls who receive the vaccine have sex earlier than those who do not have the vaccine. But this concern is one of the reasons that India – a country where more than 67,000 women die from cervical cancer every year – has refused to introduce HPV vaccine into its routine immunisation programme.', 'Leela Visaria, social researcher and honorary professor at the Gujarat Institute of Development Research in India, says: “The underlying reason why people don’t want it [the vaccine] is the fact it’s given to adolescent girls. They fear that girls will become promiscuous.”', 'Parents’ concerns about the HPV vaccine have been further fuelled by false claims about its safety. This misinformation has spread rapidly, worldwide, on social media. Japan’s take-up rate has plunged from more than 70 per cent to less than 1 per cent. Coverage has also dropped in parts of Europe, such as Denmark. In Ireland, conversely, a targeted social media campaign is reversing a sharp decline in the HPV vaccination rate.', 'Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, agrees that there is a problem in the fears that the vaccine sexualises young girls. “The other problem is that the anti-vax movement has been making false assertions about it – claims that it leads to autoimmune diseases and paralysis.', '“I think the movement is attempting to draw a line in the sand and say, ‘no more vaccines’ and when something like HPV comes along they are throwing everything they can at it. It’s having a devastating impact. I worry that we will start to export this garbage and it will impact vaccine uptake in Africa.”', '“Initially, when the HPV vaccine was introduced in different countries, there were differences of opinion on whether to focus on HPV and how it’s transmitted, or to focus on the fact that HPV leads to cancer and this vaccine will prevent cancer,” says Mark Feinberg. He is the former chief public health and science officer at Merck who was involved with the Rwanda programme.', '“Rwanda emphasised cancer prevention. It sought to communicate that the vaccine is here to protect young women from cervical cancer.”', 'Sayinzoga, from the Ministry of Health, agrees that policy makers made a conscious decision not to link the vaccine with sex. “For us, we didn’t associate the vaccine with sex. We rather focused on the side-effects of cervical cancer: that it can cause infertility. Sex wasn’t part of the campaign,” he says.', 'It’s a decision that is widely accepted by public health experts as the right one.', 'Ian Frazer, the immunologist who co-invented the first HPV vaccine, says: “The HPV vaccine has had a negative association. It has turned cervical cancer into an STI, which it is, of course, but we have to be careful. There is a right messaging for every country. Now we just talk about it as a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer. I think that’s the right strategy.”', 'In Karambi, Muhoza, who is now 17 years old, says: “You know, there are some things that cannot be talked about openly, especially when they relate to sex.”', 'When Rwanda and Merck signed their agreement, it meant that from 2011 the pharmaceutical company would supply the country with HPV vaccinations for three years at no cost.', 'As one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, Merck wanted to demonstrate that it was feasible to introduce the vaccine in low-income countries in the hope that Gavi – a global health alliance to increase access to vaccination in these countries – would take note and get on board.', '“Yes, Merck is a for-profit company, but our motivation was to maximise the impact of the vaccine. We wanted to find ways of enabling its innovations to be more broadly available,” says Feinberg, who is now president and CEO of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.', '“You quickly recognise that you have a vaccine that can have such a major impact in preventing cervical cancer, and the greatest disease burden is concentrated in the world’s poorest communities. You cannot with any conscience not come forward and make the vaccine affordable and create a sustainable vaccination programme.', '“The programme in Rwanda had two purposes: to get the vaccine to a population who could benefit, but also to demonstrate what was possible. Rwanda is an incredible country in its commitment to national health. If it wasn’t possible in Rwanda, we knew it wouldn’t be possible anywhere else.”', None, 'If it wasn’t possible in Rwanda, we knew it wouldn’t be possible anywhere else\n\t\t\t\t', 'Rwanda’s then minister of health, Agnes Binagwaho, replied publicly in a letter co-signed by two US researchers. They said that Rwanda already had very high vaccination rates for tetanus and measles, and asked: “Are the 330,000 Rwandan girls who will be vaccinated against a highly prevalent, oncogenic virus for free during the first phase of this programme not regarded as ‘the people’?”', 'Drawing an analogy with earlier opposition to antiretroviral therapy in Africa, they said that such objections were “the latest backlash against progressive health policies by African countries. When the possibility of prevention exists, writing off women to die of cancer solely because of where they are born is a violation of human rights.”', 'Binagwaho, now vice-chancellor at the University of Global Health Equity in Rwanda, is still scathing about the critics of the decision to rollout the HPV vaccine. “The people who have created a backlash haven’t done their homework – they don’t know our country, they don’t know that our kids are well vaccinated with other vaccines available. [The HPV vaccine is] a great tool to prevent one of the most ravaging women’s cancers. It is less costly to prevent cervical cancer and all its suffering.”', None, 'Almost all Rwandan girls attend school, and the systematic inclusion of local and religious leaders, community health workers and teachers in the vaccine delivery strategy has proved highly effective in spreading the message about the benefits of the vaccine and combating myths.', '“I think some of the biggest reasons why Rwanda has been so successful is, first and foremost, the political will and national mobilisation, and secondly, that they decided to do a school-based programme,” says Claire Wagner, a student at Harvard Medical School who formerly worked as research assistant to Binagwaho.', 'The success in getting girls vaccinated has boosted confidence that the country is making rapid progress towards eliminating the disease. “We are working on our goal. We put our people first,” says health minister Gashumba.', 'I think some of the biggest reasons why Rwanda has been so successful is, first and foremost, the political will and national mobilisation', 'Since 2006, more than 80 countries have introduced the HPV vaccine into their routine immunisation programmes. The majority are high-income, from Australia to the United Kingdom to Finland. These countries also have screening programmes for HPV and are moving from the pap smear test to a more advanced test, taken every five years, that detects high-risk HPV infections before cancer develops.', 'In Rwanda, before the HPV vaccine was introduced in 2011, there was no cervical cancer screening available in public health facilities – a few private clinics and NGOs offered it sporadically. Along with the vaccination programme, Rwanda also launched a national strategic plan for the prevention, control and management of cervical lesions and cancer. Women are meant to undergo visual inspection of cervix with acetic acid (VIA) at their local health centre or district hospital. Done by nurses and doctors, the screening is available to women with HIV aged 30 to 50, and other women aged 35 to 45. It’s unclear how effective and widespread this screening is.', '“The problem with VIA is that one in five women will be positive but only 5 per cent need to be treated. That is an enormous cost to the healthcare system,” Frazer says. “If we want quick results we need to have some type of screening programme, but there’s a lot of debate about what that should look like in the developing world and how feasible it is.”', 'In Bugesera, community health worker Odette Mukarumongi says the closest health centre doesn’t do cervical cancer screening. Instead, she tells girls and women that if they experience any symptoms, like pelvic pain or constant menstruation, they should go to the health centre for a check-up.', 'Given that most cervical cancer cases occur in women in their 40s and 50s, if Rwanda is going to eliminate cervical cancer it will need a robust screening programme that reaches all women – women who have not benefited from the vaccine.', 'Countries across sub-Saharan Africa and Asia have struggled to implement cervical screening programmes. Given geographical challenges, lack of funding, and competing health issues such as HIV and malaria, cervical cancer hasn’t been a priority for most policy makers. While it accounts for less than 1 per cent of all cancers in women in high-income countries, in low- and middle-income countries it’s almost 12 per cent. This is why the HPV vaccine is so critical: for girls and women in these countries it is their best – and often only – line of defence against the disease.', 'Another factor in the success of Rwanda’s campaign to end cervical cancer will be its ability to sustain the HPV vaccination programme. In 2014, Merck’s donation of Gardasil ended. As Feinberg had hoped, the Gavi alliance announced it would support Rwanda’s HPV programme through a co-financing model. Rwanda pays 20 cents per dose of the vaccine, and Gavi covers the remainder of the $4.50 cost. As the country’s economy continues to grow, its co-financing obligations will rise until it reaches a threshold after which Gavi support will phase out over a five-year period. Eventually, Rwanda will fully finance its HPV vaccine.', 'Will the country be able to afford this?', 'Sayinzoga from the Ministry of Health admits he’s concerned about the country’s ability to pay for the vaccine in future. “The HPV vaccine is very expensive.

The Financial Times, and prominent voices within its community, cautiously welcomed the move.

The son of a Jamaican father and English mother, he grew up “a working class, social security kid in a council house” in Easton, Bristol, with a frontline view of the worst of the city’s inequality.', '“We had riots in the 80s and there was obviously mistreatment of black people. I could walk down the streets and have people shout the N word,” he says. “But I learned that suffering produces perseverance, perseverance produces character and character produces hope.”', 'There has been progress – although Rees has faced racist abuse since becoming mayor – but many of the city’s challenges are the same, he says. “Bristol has huge potential but is still held back by inequalities. We currently have a life expectancy difference of around nine years between the richest and the poorest in the city.”', 'His big bet for tackling inequality is the One City Plan. Launched in January 2019, it proposes a vision for Bristol in 2050 and what needs to be achieved each year to get there. It is divided into six categories: connectivity, economy, health and wellbeing, environment, homes and communities, and learning and skills. Targets are based on the UN’s sustainable development goals, and range from making sure everyone in the city has a safe and warm home, to making Bristol carbon neutral.', 'I learned that perseverance and character produce hope\n\t\t\t\t', 'The idea is modelled on progressive plans from cities such as New York and Chicago. Getting the results is not solely the responsibility of the council; all the city’s public and private organisations (which includes two universities), should be working towards the same outcomes.', '“If somebody goes into Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership (AWP) with a mental health crisis,” Rees explains by way of example, “their recovery is not only dependent on what AWP do; it’s dependent on, did they get a home? Access to employment? What social safety nets are around them? That’s how the city works.”', 'Each of the six areas of reform will need to meet three targets each year. Some are vague – such as the promise to “tackle persistent worklessness and economic exclusion” or that “health inequalities will be reduced” in 2050 – although the plan does say that it should be treated as “a starting point from which we will develop ever-stronger future versions”.', '\n                            Marvin Rees hopes his One City Plan will tackle Bristol’s inequalities\n                    ', 'Others are highly ambitious, such as ensuring everyone in Bristol is no more than a 10-minute walk from a free learning resource by 2028 and that one of the city’s football teams will reach the Premier League by the 2024-5 season. Achieving these goals will be “a huge challenge”, Rees says, “but the only way it can be met is by the city working together. And if we fail, we all fail, because we are interdependent.”', 'One of his key aspirations is to see a consistent approach to such policy-making decisions that will outlast his time in office. That could prove key, as Rees stands for re-election in May, which he says will be for the last time. “I think, any more than that, instead of representing change you can become a barrier to it.”', 'Among the 2019 targets on the One City Plan was a pledge to end period poverty.

Solving inequality nationally requires a solid understanding of how cities operate, he argues, so government won’t tackle the challenge on its own. “You don’t pull a lever in Westminster and get outcomes. It is delivered locally. We urgently need national governance to include the leaders and networks of cities as equal partners.”', 'Rees derides “wet finger political leadership – where you lick a finger, stick it in the air and see what way the wind is blowing”.

In the past three years, 50 per cent of pupils who thought teenage pregnancy was ‘acceptable’ changed their minds after taking the workshop.

Overlooked by the blue-tinged tips of the Drakensberg Mountains, tourists flock to private nature reserves, paying top dollar for luxury safari experiences. But for local communities, it’s a different world. Almost 80 per cent of people living nearby are under the age of 35, and more than half are unemployed. Less than one per cent will have the chance of a university education.', 'Kruger is one of the largest poaching targets in southern Africa, a trade fuelled by a vast network of demand from countries such as China and Vietnam. According to South Africa’s Department of Environmental Affairs, 1,175 rhino were killed in 2015 alone.

But we have proved them wrong', 'The women act as the park’s eyes and ears, walking distances of up to 13 miles a day in the 35-degree heat to check for signs of intruders, injured animals or illegal activity. They uncover jagged metal snares set by hunters; wire holes in fences, snipped ready for a night time raid; animals maimed and killed. Their armed backup unit is never far away.', 'Night patrols see the women jumping into an old jeep, so ramshackle the door opens every time it rounds a bend, crisscrossing the beams of their torches through the darkness.

We immediately chased them, they ran, and when they looked back, we could see they were scared. I wanted to arrest them. But we lost our backup team in the scramble. We were in the middle of nowhere, alone with these men. They had guns and big knives to cut the meat. I started to be scared. I have a baby. I thought, what if they come back to kill me?”', 'The Mambas escaped unharmed that time, but the stakes are high on both sides. Many of the poachers come from the same communities as the women. “Lots of people have suffered,” says Mkhebela. “Lots of people have died, lots of women have lost their husbands. And to no benefit. It creates nothing but hate.”', 'This is my calling. Whatever it takes, I have to protect these animals', 'Many local men are of the opinion that policing the park is about carrying guns and being aggressive, but this attitude can actually lead to more violence. Spencer finds the women more likely to take their time in spotting the vital clues that poaching is taking place.', 'When they’re not working, the women spend time in the community teaching youngsters about conservation. And while men have a chance at being employed as guides on the reserve, women do not have the same opportunity. The Black Mambas challenge several stereotypes at once, head on.', 'Training is rigorous and includes learning how to avoid lions and cheetahs', 'There is some good news.

But that won’t happen at Knepp because of the one major intervention they have made.', 'Namely, introducing the animals – the Longhorns, Tamworths and the Exmoor ponies. As Tree explains, these mimic the action of ancient wild herbivores such as aurochs, bison and boar, which would once have roamed across much of Europe. Thanks to such creatures nibbling away, the landscape of the continent’s past would almost certainly not have been the unbroken wildwood of popular imagination, but a richly shifting mosaic of trees, scrub and grasses, with patches of marsh and lakes where water naturally gathers.', 'Thriving land, thriving business?', 'Another nature cliché Knepp is turning on its head is the idea that most species are restricted to very specific niches. Here, that’s clearly not the case. “Take nightingales – we’ve already got about 14 singing males, and it’s still early in the season, so it will be a bumper year,” says Tree. “Now, all the books classify them as a bird that’s found in coppice woodland, so in theory, that’s what we’d need to attract them. But we’ve got nightingales here, and they actually seem to prefer the thorny scrub. So it’s pretty clear that what they need is cover, and because they didn’t have thorny scrub in the rest of the landscape, they were ending up in coppice, because it has that dense, low understorey.”', 'Nightingales weren’t the only ones to disobey the field guides. “Every month there’s something new appearing. We’ve got nightjars. People say, ‘Oh no, you must have made a mistake, they’re a heathland bird’. But they’re here. And maybe they were only listed as a heathland bird because that was the only place left for them.”', 'It makes one reconsider many similar classifications, she adds. “Like ‘farmland birds’.

Knepp receives some agri-environmental payments from public funds, and also earns income from its ‘safari’ tourism, combined with a small eco-camping business. Then there are the standard hectare-based support payments made under the EU Common Agricultural Policy. But the estate is also dependent on rental income from cottages, along with redundant farm buildings which it’s turning into offices.', 'Not all farmers enjoy such monetisable assets, of course. And sceptics would argue that rewilding a chunk of Sussex is all very well, but we still have to produce food – beyond the delicious cuts of ‘wild range’ meat from its culled cows and pigs, which is all that Knepp does now.', '“Yes”, responds Tree, “but that doesn’t mean using every inch of land for production. We already produce more than enough to feed the world, and then we waste 40 per cent of it.”', 'There is an urgent need for a farming economy that produces other vital ‘ecosystem services’, she argues, such as restoring soils, curbing floods and soaking up carbon – all of which Knepp does.', '\n                            Little owls are proliferating at Knepp, thanks to organic soils rich in earthworms and other invertebrates.

Next up, artist Kay Rufai, who gives teens the chance to talk about what it means to be young, male and black', 'It’s not often black boys are afforded a space to express their joy. After all, media representations of black boys rarely stray beyond perpetrator or the victim of violence.', None, 'The project has caught attention for its striking portrait series of 13-year-old black boys, grinning against a vibrant-coloured backdrop, which has been on display in City Hall and at Brixton Village market. At exhibitions, Rufai says he noticed that black boys and men were particularly touched by the images, seeing themselves – or their younger selves – reflected. Mothers and mothers-to-be were also moved to tears “for this version of their children or unborn black kids”, he says.', 'But it is more than an artistic endeavour. Smile-ing Boys was devised as a direct response to the rise in youth knife crime between 2017 and 2018. While the government reacted with tougher criminalisation measures, Rufai wanted to delve deeper into the public health approach, and ask whether improving mental health care for the demographic most affected could have a positive impact.', None, 'He travelled to countries that regularly rank among the world’s happiest, such as Bhutan and Denmark, to identify why life there is so good. He came away with eight main factors he deemed responsible for happiness, which included a sense belonging and purpose, as well as freedom, security and good health.', '\n                            Portraits of some of the teens who took part in the Smile-ing Boys project\n                    ', 'That then led Rufai to the meat of the project: an eight-week arts based workshop programme for a group of 20 13-year-old black boys at a school in Brixton, south London.', 'The age group is deliberate, he tells Positive News: “They are developed enough to understand complex themes around identity, but not formed enough in their own identity to resist new ideas. It is a very pivotal stage, where they are at an important cusp in their cognitive development.”', 'Initially, Rufai found the boys hesitant to take part. “But after one session, word gets out that it is a safe space that allows them to be unapologetically authentic and be valued,” he explains. “Soon enough, requests start flying in. The boys say they feel seen, heard and inspired.”', 'The boys say they feel seen, heard and inspired\n\t\t\t\t', 'Since the pilot in Brixton, which began in 2018, he has delivered the programme at schools in three more boroughs around London, and has funding to extend it to schools in another two: Hackney and Newham. Each time, Rufai works with 20 black boys for eight weeks, assigning them weekly creative tasks such as photography or poetry, all based on the eight pillars of happiness he identified on his travels. For one assignment, the boys are given cameras to photograph a person and an area they trusted and an area that they didn’t, accompanied by a short poetry piece or caption.', 'One theme that has come up again and again across the different groups is “the lack of freedom that this demographic has and the pressure that they face, especially navigating institutions like education and the criminal justice system”, he says.', 'Rufai’s experiences as a black British-Nigerian were a key motivation behind the project. Growing up without a father, he says, inspired him to work with boys and young men in the criminal justice system, gangs and exclusion units.', '\n                            Kay Rufai with the group featured in the exhibition\n                    ', '“I saw myself in all these young boys,” Rufai recalls. “I recognised that my saving grace was the arts. So I created a project that enabled me to provide the tools that I wish I had as a 13-year-old black boy, to instil a sense of value about my identity as a black child.”', 'Seeing the project’s transformative impact on the boys’ lives has been “incredible”, Rufai says. Using the evaluation model devised for the project, he has measured a 28 per cent increase in overall happiness among the participants, and a 22 per cent increase in aspiration and self-worth.', 'Within school, the boys have demonstrated that they are better able to manage their anger, and received fewer detentions. Outside of school, too, they have avoided what Rufai describes as “violent outcomes” by using conflict resolution skills learned in the programme.', 'I saw myself in all these young boys. I recognised that my saving grace was the arts', 'One example in particular sticks in his mind. At the opening of the exhibition for the photography series, one of the participants was late. “I asked the others where he was and they gave him a call. They said he’d been stopped by a couple of guys with weapons from another area, on his way to the exhibition,” Rufai recalls. Rather than get into a fight, the boy had handed over the money he had – £10 – and made it to the exhibition. For young men like those on his pilot programme, Rufai explains, walking away rather than escalating the situation was a big step.', '“The fact that he did that and was able to come and talk about it was huge,” he says. “That was evidence of a young person understanding the power of consequence, when previously his first port of call would have been violence and that would have led to the kind of regurgitated narrative we hear about young black people all the time.”', 'For Rufai himself, the project has brought purpose. “Seeing the daily impact on the boys increases my happiness levels and my resilience to keep pushing for more change,” he says.', '\n                            Kay Rufai pictured in Finsbury Park, north London.

Funding from bodies including Arts Council England has allowed him to maintain the programme and expand into further schools, but for every grant he has received he estimates he has applied for 20 more. “It’s doing well, but that’s in spite of not having the systematic push that is necessary for it to continually reach the demographic,” he says. “It’s a journey that very much still has hurdles in the way.”', None, 'But he remains positive. Ultimately, he hopes to introduce it to every school in London, and from 2021, he intends to begin looking into how to adapt the programme for black girls as well.

He knew that, but hadn’t the resources needed to find those books.”', 'Since then, Williams has run events at scores of schools and community centres, as well as selling books at markets and festivals. She has expanded to stock toys, puzzles and clothes, plus more books telling stories from dozens of countries.', 'Covid-19 put events on pause earlier this year, but she hopes to soon be able to reach parts of the country where children from diverse backgrounds are often still treated as outsiders.', 'Although BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) children accounted for 32 per cent of UK school students in 2017, just 4.3 per cent of children’s books published that year featured a BAME character – and only 1 per cent included a person of colour as the main character.', '\n                            Just 4.3 per cent of children’s books published in 2017 featured a BAME character.

Legal purpose: how a lawyer made sustainability her career - Positive News,"['Meet Maya Mehta, an intrapreneur who is using her legal training to support the growth of sustainable finance at an investment bank', 'Meet Maya Mehta, an intrapreneur who is using her legal training to support the growth of sustainable finance at an investment bank', 'Three days before Maya Mehta was due to start her dream job, she fell over in a car park and was concussed. “I wanted to hit the ground running, but not literally,” she laughs. In fact, Mehta is grateful to have had a bit of enforced downtime to set her intentions for her new role. After all, it is what she has been working towards her entire career.', 'Having worked as a lawyer at the investment bank BNP Paribas for the past nine years, an internal secondment will now see her leading on sustainable finance from a legal perspective, which is “hugely exciting”, she says.', 'Born and growing up in London, with Indian parents who were raised in Kenya, Mehta always knew she wanted to work to end injustice. “I wanted to address social issues on the front line”, she says. She felt that understanding the law would give her the upper hand.', 'For much of her career to date, though, her commitment to the causes she cared about had to be slotted in alongside her day job as a capital markets lawyer, first at Clifford Chance, and then BNP Paribas. Mehta talks of “my purpose pile” of pro bono work “that I would reach for in fragments of spare time, whenever I could.” At first, it was focused on helping those caught in cycles of domestic abuse; later it was microfinance, and then, about four years ago, a new world opened up for her.', '\n                            ""I wanted to address social issues on the front line,"" says Mehta.

One evening in 2016 she went to a talk about green bonds, part of the fast-emerging set of new financial instruments that put a value on environmental protection and sustainability. Fired up by its potential, she started using her legal expertise to give colleagues advice on the subject, and became convinced that it was a real area of opportunity.', 'In 2018, she decided to approach a senior manager about this growing field, with a view to bringing together legal colleagues who were working on sustainable investment projects across the bank. “He said ‘OK, let’s gather the evidence’. So I sent out an email to every lawyer in the bank which said: ‘Have you worked on a sustainable finance transaction?’. And the response I got was overwhelming. All these lawyers across the globe, from Brazil to India to Hong Kong, were working on solar projects, wind projects, environmental shipping and other positive environmental and social solutions.”', 'Mehta was bolstered by the response, seeing that these colleagues were cut from the same cloth as her; in other words, they were sustainable intrapreneurs. Back in 2001, when she started training as a solicitor, the phrase had yet to make its way into the business lexicon, but now she saw that her colleagues worldwide were also doing what she had been doing for years: making positive change happen from within the heart of the corporate world.', 'The response I got was overwhelming. All these lawyers were working on solar projects, wind projects and other positive environmental and social solutions\n\t\t\t\t', 'That changemaking has been a golden thread running through Mehta’s career to date. As a trainee with Clifford Chance in Hong Kong, she had provided pro bono support to Filipino domestic helpers who were being abused by their employers. Later, her attention turned to the struggles of Asian women in London subjected to forced marriages and domestic violence. She started an advice clinic in the east London borough of Newham, where she and fellow colleagues would offer lunchtime sessions. Then she turned her attention to microfinance, setting up a global group to help fellow lawyers at Clifford Chance provide pro bono advice in this area.', 'But it became exhausting. “I became a victim of my own success”, she admits, “because the microfinance group was growing and growing and I was working until one in the morning.”', 'It was around that time that she decided to leave the law firm for BNP Paribas. Naturally, she brought her intrapreneurship with her, co-founding a social impact hub in the UK to help colleagues develop the skills and resources they need to support social enterprises and microfinance organisations. Then came her passion for green bonds and sustainable financial instruments more generally, which, thanks to her secondment, she can now do full-time. The ‘purpose pile’ has finally moved to the centre of her desk.', 'Her new responsibilities include growing the global community of lawyers across BNP Paribas who are integrating sustainability into their skillset, and training them to “navigate the maze of sustainable finance regulation on the horizon”.', 'I jump out of bed in the morning and I have this hunger to learn\n\t\t\t\t', None, 'Meanwhile, financial instruments are increasingly seen as having a key role to play in tackling urgent social issues of our time. “One Friday afternoon when we were deep in lockdown, I received an email from my business colleagues saying that we need to work on a new type of bond, a Covid-19 response bond, to help channel funds into healthcare and social issues.”', None, None, 'Get Positive News stories in your inbox each week', None]",https://www.positive.news/economics/legal-purpose-how-a-lawyer-made-sustainability-her-career/

But those aren’t necessarily the ideal attributes of a responsible leader in a time of crisis, whether triggered by Covid-19 or the slow rolling menace of climate change.', 'In the old days, a responsible leader was supposed to be all about “command and control, stiff upper lip, in charge and on top”, says Katie Duckworth, who specialises in coaching leaders of purpose-driven organisations.
