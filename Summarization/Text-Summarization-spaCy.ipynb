    "**Approach:** We look at which words occur most often in an article. We weight our keywords accordingly and calculate the importance of each sentence. So it is [TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency)](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/what-is-tf-idf/) - *a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a collection of documents*. The sentence with the most important words will have the most importance. At the end we get the most important X sentences as a summary or bullet points. "
