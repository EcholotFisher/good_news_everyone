Documents and photos that could shed a light on these practices are routinely denied to the public. “This secrecy adds to our concerns that what has happened to these animals would not stand up to public scrutiny,” says Mr Kriek. \\nThe limited information available to the author of the report indicates widespread animal suffering, from calves born without bladders, liver failure, still births, limb deformities, abnormally large ovaries and a number of other health problems. \\nSAFE is calling on the Government to halt the genetic engineering of animals and order the release of all documentation of past research so that the true extent of animal suffering can be evaluated. \\nENDS</td>\n",

(Kremlin) By Charles Krauthammer Opinion writer October 22 at 8:27 PM Follow @krauthammer Guess who just popped up in the Kremlin? Bashar al-Assad, Syrian dictator and destroyer, now Vladimir Putin’s newest pet. After four years holed up in Damascus, Assad was summoned to Russia to bend a knee to Putin, show the world that today Middle East questions get settled not in Washington but in Moscow, and officially bless the Russian-led four-nation takeover of Syria now underway.\\nDoes the bewildered Obama administration finally understand what Russia is up to?\\nCharles Krauthammer writes a weekly political column that runs on Fridays. View Archive Facebook RSS President Obama says Russia is doomed to fail in the Syrian quagmire. But Russia is not trying to reconquer the country for Assad. It is consolidating a rump Syrian state in the roughly 20 percent of the country he now controls, the Alawite areas stretching north and west from Damascus through Latakia and encompassing the Russian naval base at Tartus.\\nIt’s a partition. It will leave the Islamic State in control in the interior north and east. Why is this doomed to failure?\\nPutin’s larger strategy is also obvious. He is not reconstructing the old Soviet empire. That’s too large a task. But he is rebuilding and reasserting Russia’s ability to project power beyond its borders. Annexing Crimea restores to the motherland full control of the warm-water Black Sea port that Russia has coveted since Peter the Great. Shoring up a rump Alawite state secures Russia’s naval and air bases in the eastern Mediterranean. Add to that Russia’s launching of advanced cruise missiles from warships in the Caspian Sea to strike Syrian rebels 900 miles away and you have the most impressive display of Russian military reach since the Cold War.\\nFor Obama, of course, these things don’t matter. “In today’s world,” he told the U.N. last month, “the measure of strength is no longer defined by the control of territory.” That he clearly believes this fantasy was demonstrated by his total abandonment of Iraq, forfeiting U.S. bases from which we could have projected power in the region (most notably preventing, through control of Iraqi airspace, the Iranian rearming and reinforcement of Assad’s weakening regime).\\nWhile Obama counts on the arc of the moral universe</td>\n",

The Republican governor told about 100 people in Lewiston that lawmakers from southern Maine dominate the legislative process with the intent of keeping prosperity for themselves. The Sun Journal (http://bit.ly/1OBP2dK ) reported that the governor said, \"People in the south part of Maine will not allow people in northern Maine to earn a good living.\" He added, \"I know it sounds hard and cruel, but it's a fact.\" He referred specifically to failed efforts to ease restrictions on mineral mining in northern Maine. In July, LePage scolded a Cape Elizabeth resident in a handwritten note, saying she lives in a region where people \"exploit those who are not so fortunate.\" seacoastonline.com Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 12:40 PM » Comment or view comments</td>\n",

Documents and photos that could shed a light on these practices are routinely denied to the public. “This secrecy adds to our concerns that what has happened to these animals would not stand up to public scrutiny,” says Mr Kriek. \\nThe limited information available to the author of the report indicates widespread animal suffering, from calves born without bladders, liver failure, still births, limb deformities, abnormally large ovaries and a number of other health problems. \\nSAFE is calling on the Government to halt the genetic engineering of animals and order the release of all documentation of past research so that the true extent of animal suffering can be evaluated. \\nENDS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Moscow on Oct. 21. Russia has supported the Syrian government throughout that nation's civil war. (Kremlin) By Charles Krauthammer Opinion writer October 22 at 8:27 PM Follow @krauthammer Guess who just popped up in the Kremlin? Bashar al-Assad, Syrian dictator and destroyer, now Vladimir Putin’s newest pet. After four years holed up in Damascus, Assad was summoned to Russia to bend a knee to Putin, show the world that today Middle East questions get settled not in Washington but in Moscow, and officially bless the Russian-led four-nation takeover of Syria now underway.\\nDoes the bewildered Obama administration finally understand what Russia is up to?\\nCharles Krauthammer writes a weekly political column that runs on Fridays. View Archive Facebook RSS President Obama says Russia is doomed to fail in the Syrian quagmire. But Russia is not trying to reconquer the country for Assad. It is consolidating a rump Syrian state in the roughly 20 percent of the country he now controls, the Alawite areas stretching north and west from Damascus through Latakia and encompassing the Russian naval base at Tartus.\\nIt’s a partition. It will leave the Islamic State in control in the interior north and east. Why is this doomed to failure?\\nPutin’s larger strategy is also obvious. He is not reconstructing the old Soviet empire. That’s too large a task. But he is rebuilding and reasserting Russia’s ability to project power beyond its borders. Annexing Crimea restores to the motherland full control of the warm-water Black Sea port that Russia has coveted since Peter the Great. Shoring up a rump Alawite state secures Russia’s naval and air bases in the eastern Mediterranean. Add to that Russia’s launching of advanced cruise missiles from warships in the Caspian Sea to strike Syrian rebels 900 miles away and you have the most impressive display of Russian military reach since the Cold War.\\nFor Obama, of course, these things don’t matter. “In today’s world,” he told the U.N. last month, “the measure of strength is no longer defined by the control of territory.” That he clearly believes this fantasy was demonstrated by his total abandonment of Iraq, forfeiting U.S. bases from which we could have projected power in the region (most notably preventing, through control of Iraqi airspace, the Iranian rearming and reinforcement of Assad’s weakening regime).\\nWhile Obama counts on the arc of the moral universe   \n",

The Sun Journal (http://bit.ly/1OBP2dK ) reported that the governor said, \"People in the south part of Maine will not allow people in northern Maine to earn a good living.\" He added, \"I know it sounds hard and cruel, but it's a fact.\" He referred specifically to failed efforts to ease restrictions on mineral mining in northern Maine. In July, LePage scolded a Cape Elizabeth resident in a handwritten note, saying she lives in a region where people \"exploit those who are not so fortunate.\" seacoastonline.com Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 12:40 PM » Comment or view comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
